ReviewContent
"Good. It IS a page turner. You can read this book in one day, two at the most, and the plot drives the whole book. The unreliable narrators (there are two besides the main character) are as unlikable as they are unreliable, and there isn't a nice male in the book. Entirely plot driven; the characters are paper thin. You can figure out who-dunnit by the middle of the book. The ending is weak. I can't imagine what all the fuss is about, except that it is quick and there are lots of twists and turns, and you can't trust anyone to tell the truth."
"There are no words for how much I loathed this book.  This was the first audiobook I ever listened to so not sure if something was lost in translation here, if I just disliked the narrators, or if it is truly the book I hated - but man oh man I hated this book and have no idea what the hype is about.  Maybe if I READ it I would have liked it better but none of the characters were likable, the narration was rote and emotionless, and the writing was so ... basic.  ""I sat on the bed.  I got off the bed.  I sat back on the bed.  I poured myself another drink,  I don't want to drink.  I can't stop myself.  I'm going to drink.""  Not a direct quote from the book but you get the picture.  I thought it went way longer than necessary.  I honestly can't figure out why everyone was in love with this book."
"I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: ""I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember."" I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna. I don't even remember her place in the story I cared about her so little. Oh, right, she's the woman who is responsible for the breakdown of Rachel's marriage and is now married to Rachel's ex, Tom.As others have noted, the three female characters have little to discern them from each other, and speak in a nearly identical voice - except one of them drinks. All three lament about men - constantly. They seem to have no other life interests - not one has a hobby, a job, or anything compelling her forward from day to day that doesn't have to do with a guy. (The guys all turn out to be jerks.)I suppose people like this do exist, I'm just not sure why I'm supposed to care about them - or why anyone else did, or how this book got to be so popular. I've heard it was compared to Gone Girl but other than both having a missing woman at the core, and 'Girl' in the title, there seems to be no comparison whatsoever.The 'twist' isn't a twist in the slightest, just the reveal of the missing woman's murderer, and it's exactly who, about three-fourths of the way through (and I'm not good at guessing twists), you suspect it is.  Then the 'reveal' is the guy confessing he did it in a speech you'd hear some cartoonish villain give in a super hero movie or soap opera. That kind of 'Bwahahaha I did it!' thing. Very convenient.But I guess the biggest thing that bothered me was that the entire crux of the story is based on the idea that Rachel has an alcoholic blackout - and the author explains (twice) that when you are having an alcoholic blackout, your brain does not create memories - so there is nothing to 'remember'- but then lo and behold she suddenly has a memory breakthrough, and solves the crime. I thought she wouldn't have been creating memories? It's as if the author wrote half her book, then decided to do some research (googling) and when she found research that blatantly contradicted the plot point her book hinges on, decided ""Oh, what the heck, I'll keep writing"" and then decided to INCLUDE her research. And her editor didn't notice or (more likely) didn't care.A couple of other things an editor (if this book had one) should have picked up on: Much is made of a pile of clothes by the train tracks - so much so that the book opens with a description of them - the importance of the clothes? None. Zip. Zero. And there's a red haired man who keeps popping up - muttering esoteric things - we assume he will be integral to the mystery. Nope, he just disappears.Other stuff I could complain about but it would be spoilery. It seems if books are bought by book clubs, they become huge sellers, no matter how evisceratingly terrible (witness 50 Shades of Grey).Here's one thing I admire the author for: She wrote this book in four months (it shows) and it became a HUGE bestseller. Awesome for her. So few authors ever make it to that level - even with stunningly well-written books - so kudos to her for whatever alchemy happened to guarantee she's got some money to retire on."
"Three disjointed characters for whom it's hard to feel sympathy or empathy as they are presented in such a superficial way you can't feel for any of them.Plot dragged on and ending was very unsubstantial - definitely not worth the ""Gone Girl"" comparisons."
"Was snookered into this novel as it was compared to Gone Girl, which I liked a lot...This one is filled with dysfunctional characters who you wouldn't care to spend any time with in real life...I figured out who ""done it"" early on and by the end I imagined an alternative ending which was not a happy ending for the whole lot of them...Can't believe it remains on the bestseller list!"
"I'm an editor by trade, so I found the numerous run-ons a bit distracting. I also had trouble keeping track of the story when the chapters jumped back-and-forth in time; it's very easy (and a bit disorienting) to end up halfway through a chapter before realizing that scene isn't a continuation of the previous chapter, but a completely different incident taking place in the past. Girl on the Train also left too many loose ends for my liking: for example, who is the red-haired man and why was he so important to include into the story if he doesn't do anything other than show up at inopportune times and (sort of) hit on the main character?I have to wonder if the author has personal experience with alcoholism, because the way she depicted the main character's thought process was very much in line with what I've seen from recovering addicts. That part is very effectively written; at the same time, it does make the main character harder to relate to, especially if you've never experienced it.Overall, it's not a terrible book, but I don't get the hype over it. As my book club friend described it, Girl on the Train is an airplane book: fine for killing a couple hours when you're traveling and have nothing better to do."
"This was the most boring book I have ever read. According to my Kindle I managed 32% before I gave up. The character was lifeless, the story was lifeless and just meandered along at a snails pace. The premise was totally unbelievable unless the train moved at the same speed as the snail. No dialogue just endless narrative of something. Completely unreadable."
"I have to admit a prejudice: I don't like to read books where I cannot identify even one character that I like.  That is the case with this book.  All the characters are narcissistic stereotypes. That the characters are well drawn and the story well structured is all the more reason for my dislike.  I had a hard time distinguishing the difference between the two male protagonists and the three females except that the main character Rachel is less attractive and a drunk.  Of course she wasn't always that way, at one time she was...just like the other two.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the writing is done well.  I don't know if it is just my bias but I seldom find that books that are immensely popular hold up well when read."
"Hmmmm, after everything I read and heard about this book, I expected to be unable to put it down. Sadly, I was only too happy to put it down -- if I could send it back and get a refund, I surely would!This is a story about a drunk and a hyper-sexed suburban housewife. First, a reader cannot really care about any of the sad and sick characters in the book; second, there is no suspense -- you know the plot line and conclusion within the first 100 pages; and third, a reader  has only one thing to sustain himself -- how long will it take the drunk to remember? It is a pointless story with prosaic prose (not a single highlighted sentence in my copy!) and paper-thin characters. II cannot think of a single redeeming quality about this book except that it did not go on any longer. Had it ended in the first 25 pages, I would have been grateful to the author for putting me out of my misery associated with buying this book!!Unless you are hankering to be bored or fall into a deep slumber while reading this book, do not buy or read it."
"I have heard this book compared to Gone Girl because of the unreliable narrator device. Fans of Gone Girl generally, do not like the comparison, however, I feel that it was apt. Both of the books were long slogs about characters that I did not care about at all. In order for me to enjoy a book, there must be at least one character in the book that I like. The story was not that compelling. The characters were whiny or self-serving. The pacing was glacial.I would never have picked up this book on my own after my experience of reading Gone Girl except it was a selection of my book club. Any book that is compared to Gone Girl will be a book that I will strike from my list of possible reads. Girl on a Train also has one of the worst covers that I have ever seen. The lettering on the cover is probably very effective in trying to give a feeling of motion because it gives me motion sickness every time I look at it.This book was not an enjoyable read for me. I don't like unreliable narrators. I don't like books filled with unsympathetic characters. I don't like books that flip back and forth with time. I cannot recommend this book to anyone unless you enjoy the things that I don't."

I am half way through this book and can honestly say I hate it. I can't believe all of the good reviews--I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The character development is weak--and I don't like any of them. It's B-O-R-I-N-G. I would advise you to skip this book and save your money...but obviously some other people like this book. I just don't know why!!!

"I have just started reading e-books and thought I'd try this since I had a bus ride to take and the other book I am reading is 4 inches thick. I don't like books with prologue sections that try to hook you and leave you waiting half the book -- or more -- to find out what that was all about, but this one was brief, so onward.  I think I read the whole first chapter before starting to flick quickly through the screen pages:  Boring, flat, self-pitying, boring, paralyzed, nothing happening, how many pages devoted to Rachel's drinking and phone calls?, boring. . . .Anna, who cares?. . . Jess who is not Jess. . .Eesh. I gave up. The tone is very flat, even when the narrating character changes. I found myself wondering if this was indeed a mystery. Amazon has just informed me that it is. . . but the only mystery to me is why this book has been so successful."
"I was not expecting more than a ""beach book read"" but this was really bad.  It amazes me what ends up on the NYT bestseller list and book club selections.  To be in either catagory would suggest a minium amount of competency.  Out of sheer stuborness I stuck with it to see if it would improve but it just kept getting worse.  The ending was so awful, worse than the rest of the book, if that is at all possible.Totally confirmed my opinion that this is a little stinker of a book.  Not worth your time or money.P.S.  Some reviewers seem to have misread the NYT review.  They actually gave it a very bad review but I thought for $6.99 I would give it a try!"
"If you're wondering what the international ruckus is about this book, don't. I regret having squandered precious time on this overrated bestseller. The novel is simplistically written, predictably plotted, and littered with self-obsessed, uninteresting characters."
"I don't understand the hype around this book. I can't finish it, let alone recommend it. I've forced myself to read half of it, but have given up -  it's just too annoying. It is well-written from a technical standpoint, but just drags along, with the narrator droning on about her failed marriage, drinking problem and depression. I wouldn't want to put up with her in real life, so I certainly don't want to waste time reading about a fictional character like this. Maybe she shakes it off in the end, but I don't care enough to find out."
"I am surprised this has been on the best seller list for so long.  I have read many better  written books over the years and this does not rank in the quality for a ""Best Seller"".  Neither did the ""Gold Finch"" which makes me skeptical of buying supposed best sellers."
"Well, it is a compelling mystery. But all the characters are quite unlikeable. Everyone of them is so deeply flawed and make such rotten choices. Again and again and again. It got quite tiresome. I'm giving it three stars because its an easy read and the story is engaging - in a guilty pleasure kind of way...a lot like those aweful choices in the story. I just kept reading."
"This book was recommended by a friend who described it as impossible to put down. I read it fairly quickly and though I agree the story builds quickly and relentlessly -- but the story is dark and, for me, without reason or purpose. I found the main character troubled but mostly unsympathetic --damaged without the author offering much in the way of why. In fact most of the characters ranged from unsympathetic to pathological. One-dimensional -- completely self-deluded, completely self-absorbed -- completely psychopathic. Unsettling just for the purpose of building suspense. This is not a book I would recommend."

"I really did not enjoy reading this at all. If it wasn't for the movie that is coming out soon, I honestly would have quit reading very shortly after starting. It's, in my opinion, very exaggerated in the way it plays out the plot. I lost interest a few times, especially with how annoying the main character is. None of the characters are likeable, or supposed to be likeable, which I get, but it leaves the reader unable to connect to the main or even supporting characters in the book. A lot of the actions felt extremely forced, like they had to be created for the story line so the situations came off unplausible. I found myself bored more than once, and truly celebrated being finished with it. I gave it two stars instead of one, because at least it had a good editor and satisfying(ish) ending."
"I was intrigued by the beginning, but is anyone else seriously disappointed in the last 1/4 of the book?  SPOILER ALERT: Do not read further if you have not read the book!Really?  Two men on the same block who physically abuse the same two women in the same exact way?  It seems like there wasn't too much thought put into the male characters, and the last quarter of the book doesn't feel organic -- it feels contrived and forced.The female lead's actions at the end also make her incredibly stupid.  If you figure out that someone is a killer, you DO NOT physically go to that person's house and tell said murderer that you know what happened.  I can understand if these people were teenagers, but in their 30s?  Seriously?  Greatly disappointed."
"Everyday, Rachel takes the train to work. As the train comes to halt at a signal, she daydreams about the people in the houses she sees. She watches the moments of their lives that she observes from the train, and she makes up stories about them. This is merely daydreaming, until the day she witnesses something. Then, everything changes!As I read this, I kept thinking about that voyeuristic quality that I enjoyed in Hitchcock’s REAR WINDOW. We all seem to enjoy looking into other people’s lives and catching a glimpse of what a stranger’s private life might be like.This book kept me guessing until the last minute. Because the author narrated different chapters in the first person by three alternating characters, we are able to get to know them from the inside out, understand how their minds work, and see how they evolve as the tension of the murder mystery builds. This is a very clever way to both allow the reader to relate to the characters and their feelings, as well as to tell a story from varying viewpoints. I bet you can’t put this one down! I couldn’t!"
"4.5 starsCan't really explain why this story grabbed me like it did. On the surface, it doesn't seem like it should have.  It's told in first person, which I prefer, but in present tense, which I hate.  I can understand the comparison to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which I loved, in that the characters aren't the least bit likable or the kind of people anyone would want to be friends with. Rachel is weak and whiny, Anna is self-absorbed and stupid, and Megan is self-indulgent and reckless. All three are ridiculously juvenile. There's very little dialogue, a huge part of the narrative is backstory, and one of the characters is constantly blacking out and remembers nothing, which I found not all that believable. Then there's the fact I guessed early on ""whodunnit"".And yet, it was a remarkably gripping read.  I was compelled to finish.  I wish I could put my finger on why.  You'll just have to dig in and see if it grabs you, too.  But know this, I am a very difficult reader to satisfy, but this book was strangely gratifying."

"Wasn't my favorite. I read it after ""The Husbands Secret"" as it was one of the recommended based on the books.  The first few chapters were a bit of a hard read to get through.  I had to keep switching back and fourth between the chapter I was reading to the chapter prior to it to remember the names and characters mentioned already.  I was pretty annoyed with the main character and everything about her.  From the first chapter she was introduced I was like ""ugh"".  She reminded me of a Jenji Kohan character, someone who just does stupid stuff all the time but yet remains in the lead. Just wasn't all the ""hype"" I was expecting.  The best part of the book when I was actually enjoying it was the last 2 chapters.  Prior to the last chapters I was just struggling to get through it and forcing myself to finish it only because I paid for it.  I hate starting books and not finishing them.  I'll finish the worst book even if it takes me 10 months off and on because I don't like leaving books unfinished.  Simply ok. Nothing amazing."
"Rachel, still raw after her divorce, travels past her former home twice a day on the commuter train. She becomes interested in an ideal couple living in a house a few doors down from where she used to live, concocting an idyllic life for the two.  Then the wife disappears, and Rachel finds herself obsessed with the mystery -- where has she gone? What has happened? Can she help the grieving husband find answers and deflect suspicion away from him? Convinced she has seen things from the train that give her extra insight into the couple, she inserts herself into the investigation. Meanwhile Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife, contributes to the narrative, giving us a different view of Rachel and her motives, and making no bones about the fact that she views Rachel's intervention as an attempt to stalk her family.  In chapters alternating between Anna, Rachel, and Megan, the woman who has disappeared from her perfect life, the book gives us 3 different points of view of the story -- none of which prepares  us for the book's shocking finale."
"Ugh. So many glowing reviews, so much hype, a forthcoming movie... Color me confused. (Well, not on the movie bit -- doesn't take a good story to make a few bucks from a moving picture show).I was expecting something groundbreaking, or at the very least, something original. You'd think I'd learn not to put so much stock into reader reviews, and that even the NYTimes and NPR aren't always on target with their literary praise, but, alas, I bought into the hype.The story was banal and dull, and frankly, rather juvenile in form. There's nothing interesting or exciting in the writing style (I feel like you have to be REALLY good to pull off first-person -- it wasn't successful here), and at no point did the author convince me to care what happened to the characters (which is funny, because I'm a 30-something female who could (in theory) relate to some facets of the characters' lives).There's nothing compelling about this book, and it is an absolute mystery to me why so many glowing reviews!I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't even download the Kindle preview first. Looking for a good, late-summer read, I saw the great reviews and grabbed the whole book. My dumb mistake! You'd think I would have learned to always get the preview -- it is, after all, what saved me from the awful writing of EL James."
"I finally succumbed and bought this book to see what all the hoopla was about and, no, I haven’t seen the movie. I found it to be a super entertaining read. I finished it in the ‘wee smalls,’ unable to put it down. What I really liked about it was that though I thought I’d figured out who the evil doer was at the very beginning, the author kept leading me astray … so that I abandoned my first impression only to be surprised at the end when I found that I was right from the start!The story is told from alternating points of view which I liked, too.The novel is dark and fast-paced, the characters are complex and the plot is compelling. Highly recommended for thriller fans. Five big, bright, shiny stars"
"I had to read this book for a book club. If you spend most of your time voyouristically watching the lives of others rather than living your own life, if you love drunks and the havoc they wreak in your life and their's, if you adore weak, pathetic women who climb into a bottle at the first inkling of duplicity by their husbands, if you have a soft spot for good looking psychopaths, if you keep falling for weak men, by golly this is the book for you. The three-way point of view is a stupid contrivance for a pathetic storyline. The only character I liked or respected was Evie. Although she had no dialogue, she had the good sense to remain quite at critical times in the story. If this is the best Paula Hopkins can write, she has my sympathy. And, if the next generation really is similar to these characters, then God help us all. We're doomed."
"If you're wondering what the international ruckus is about this book, don't. I regret having squandered precious time on this overrated bestseller. The novel is simplistically written, predictably plotted, and littered with self-obsessed, uninteresting characters."
"After such great reviews I had hope this would be a good book. I like books about imperfect people; Gillian Flynn books or Bingham's Fiona Griffiths are my cup of tea. But, this is a book about stupid pathetic people, I don't have the patience for that. I did finish the book though and I am not disappointed that I read the book. I am glad I did, so I can tell you not to rely on the good reviews too much. Get it from the library to be on the safe side."
"Where do I begin? So, you have a women who's lost everything, fakes going to work, has a drinking problem, creates a story in her head about a couple she watches from a train, still obsesses over her ex-husband, claims to know the missing women in the story when she doesn't, starts seeing one of the suspects so she can try to be a private eye, sleeps with...Man, this women needs a life!I was super excited to check it out but quickly became extremly dissapointed. The pace was slow, the repitition was annoying, could had done without all the internal dialouge, the chronological order threw me off and as much as I wanted to I could not feel for any of the charcters.Sighs..."
"Like the outdated train tracks that Rachel rides across every day, what was billed as interesting is actually tedious and boring.  The books repetitive plot devices have been done to death.  It doesn't even hold up well enough to be a guilty pleasure or a campy beach read.  Its not a particularly good escape because there is nothing about her world that makes you want to be there.  Rather the story grates on in an irritatingly self-absorbed fashion....much like Rachel making yet another justification to herself to have yet another drink or three.And ike a drunkard's ramble, the story stumbles around until it reaches the end with a final, unsastisfying, meh."
"First off, I enjoyed this book. The plot was good. The pacing was good. The limited, first-person points-of-view is an effective mechanism for this story. I did figure it out, but I did not nail it down too quickly. I was definitely interested to see how it resolved. The characters, however--except for maybe two--are not exactly relatable. Each is thoroughly flawed with minimal self-awareness or empathy for anyone else. I suppose if you put enough self-absorbed folks within proximity of one another, something's bound to happen. It does! Trying to figure out what that something was and who did it was good fun. I might have liked actually liking somebody involved in all that mess, though. (Or maybe it's better that I didn't.)"
"There has been much talk about this book and being a fan of thrillers I couldn't wait to read it. I found it tedious and hard to get through. The two stars are for the way the author crafted the story and the skill used in making all her characters so utterly pathetic that i didn't care what happened to any of them and I wanted them all to meet their demise by the end. I can see why people liked it as unpredictable, I wasn't surprised by the end though I was hoping for it."
"I finally had to stop reading this book, a rarity for me.  I generally slog on, figuring that eventually everything will come together and it will be worth the parts I didn't enjoy.  This book, however, just didn't engage me.  I didn't like the characters and I couldn't get into the story.  I've read a lot of books where the protagonist's self destructive behavior and addictive personality are woven into the story.  However, in this case, she just seems sort of pathetic; I can't work up any empathy for her and finally, I just didn't want to read any more about her.  The other characters were sort of slimy as well.  Obviously others don't share my view of this book, but hey, that's why we have so many authors in the world!"
"Knowing this book was a best seller and had been made into a movie was what attracted me.  As probably all mystery/suspense genre readers do, I speculated on who might be the bad guy (nothing personal, fellas), and found myself waffling.  I did not, however, find the writing or story development as enchanting as the rest of its readers must have.  In my experience, the movie is never as good as the book.  This may be an exception."
"You know those movies, where there is a perfectly normal character who then, in the final act,  is suddenly revealed to be a psychopath?  Who, instead of killing the person who has figured it out, incredulously decides to confess to them everything they did and why they did it?  It is that cliched plot device that gives the cornered ""good guy"" the opportunity and the time to thwart the ""bad guy.""  It is lazy and uninspired writing, and it left me feeling cheated.This book commits the cardinal sin of writing.  It tells the story instead of showing the story. I'd wait for the next train if I were you."
"I finally decided to start putting down the iPad and get back to print. This was one of 3 recent book orders. Love the story. The quality of the book and print is HORRIBLE! Not sure who's manufacturing but you should never use them. Print is so bad I can't read some pages. My eyes are bad enough, I don't need a book that creates double vision! Paper is not bound well. Book will surely fall apart before I'm done. How disappointing! But, this is a first so not giving up on print yet!"
"I couldn't wait for this book to come out. It was such a disappointment. This was probably the darkest book I've ever read. Just when I thought It couldn't get any darker, it did. There were only five main characters. Not only were they all dysfunctional but it was hard to keep them straight. When the story was being told from each respective character's point of view, the writing tones were all the same and sometimes it was hard to determine who was actually doing the talking. But, I didn't give it up and finished it to its dark ending. There was absolutely no uplifting parts to tis book."
"The reader becomes a voyeur into the life of a voyeur. The characters in this book are definitely out of the norm (I hope), each with some serious problems and some extreme behaviors. There is an air of mystery as I was almost reluctantly drawn into the story, wanting to know more about these creepy people and to learn what had actually happened to them, as the story unfolds from different perspectives. It would be impossible to lump any character into a category of either ""good"" or ""bad,"" as (with all humans) each is a complex combination of both. All seem to be in need of a trusted friend,partner and/or counselor. But wait! These needs are being met by those types of people throughout the book - or are they? Is anyone truly worthy of trust? (Note: The sex and violence is not explicit.)"
"I don't know why we have this morbid fascination with murdered young women, but we do, and with all the good and mediocre novels on the subject, this one stands out as superior. It is very clever and fast-paced with a unique twist. The main character, Rachel, who has been deeply wounded by betrayal in her marriage, has become a bitter, jealous drunk, and yet she is totally lovable. When she is not harassing her ex and his new wife, she is watching the lives of others out the window of the train on her daily commute, and living vicariously through them. Until something happens that changes several lives. And Rachel saw something significant, but she can't remember what it was because she was in a blackout. Read it. You'll love it."
"I was really excited about this one, as so many people were raving over how good it was at the time I read it. Unfortunately I found it hard to get into – nothing much happened in the first 100 pages. Characters were too depressing and pathetic. Not really fond of novels where woman are written as victims who don’t do anything to help themselves, even when they start to figure out somethings wrong. Mystery wasn’t that clever or original. Liked her writing style so will try her next book, but hope it’s better than this one."
"Terrible, can't understand why it is on the bestseller list ."
"According to other reviewers, The Girl on the Train was compared to Gone Girl.  This is NO Gone Girl!  About 1/2 way through the book, I realized who dun it.  From that point on, I found the content to very redundant and 'spoon fed' to me.  I also thought there was a slightly significant difference between actual text at the end of the book and a scene leading up to the end.  Without giving too much away, the discrepancy specifically involved reference to a corkscrew,If you want a REALLY good read like Gone Girl, read Sharp Objects (or even Dark Places) and skip reading The Girl on the Train.As far as the author's writing it is somewhere between ok and good."
"I almost stopped reading it by chapter 3 - but it was suggested I finish it ""it will get better""  It didn't...was a waste of time and very disappointing.  A one star is too much for this.  I'd rather read a cereal box."
"I do find myself agreeing with several other readers that the main character was a touch difficult to connect with. At least at first.As the story unfolded and the end grew ever closer, it became clear why she'd fallen into her drinking habits and why her life was such a mess.However, I will say that if you've spent as much time reading these sorts of thrillers and studying them as I have, you may not be quite as shocked at the big reveal as others. I had it figured out several chapters ahead of time, but reading the characters reactions was still enjoyable.Overall, a fairly decent thriller!"
"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.  The narration dragged along in some parts, but overall it held enough suspense to keep me basically hooked til the end.  Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel."
"There's nothing particular that I can point out about why I hated this book.  I did finish it, just because I wanted to find out if Rachel was truly as crazy as I thought she was (she is).  I bought this based on ""if you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this"".  The only thing this book has in common with Gone Girl is that the main character was absolutely batshit crazy.  She's developed, but predictable.  She continually gets drunk, feels bad about it, then makes the same mistakes over and over again.  She is continually abusing the people in her life who are just trying to help her.  The ending did take me by surprise for about 3 sentences, then I figured out exactly what was going to happen.  Again, this is by far not the worst book I've ever read, but don't plan to read anything Paula Hawkins ever writes again."
"For once the movie was pretty close to the same as how the book was laid out, with the book of course always going into more detail because you have the narrative to back up the storyline. I do think having watched the movie before reading the book helped because the book switches back and forth many times between different timelines that would have otherwise been confusing to keep up with. Overall I was not disappointed with the book and had been wanting to read it for quite some time, glad I did."
"I really enjoyed reading this novel.  I appreciate novels that spend time developing character and this one did. Telling the story by weaving the tale together by proving us with seeing things from the aspect of the characters involved adds to the readers enjoyment by providing more mystery to the tale. In addition, I enjoy stories that show flawed characters, which we all are, and this one had its share.  ...and, as always, the book was a lot better better than the movie."
"Here we go again I thought,when I was reading about a young girl,she feels she is not longer desirable,because she off-putting in some weight,divorce,alcoholic,lost control of her life, misery,loneliness,mentally unstable,almost stop reading this great book,is very interesting keep you in suspense,I didn't do nothing all day,I can't put it down,is so good reading,I didn't waste my day,this book is worthy my time,ha ha ha, I recommended you will like it a lot,I give 5 stars because keep me like a glued,and that is something that makes me happy,Thelma."
"This book made feel goosebumps. Certain parts were written very well that it had me looking behind my shoulder. Good mystery had me guessing pretty much the whole way convincing me along the way that it could of been others. Only negative to me was that some parts felt like fillers pointless and dragging on very few though. I recommend this to any mystery reader, people struggling with alcohol (me), and I personally think those books are awfully written but any fan of fifty shades of grey would enjoy this. Watching the film later."
"The inner thoughts in this book are compelling narratives by women who act badly and hate themselves for it. Unremitting self-destructive thoughts, abuse of themselves and getting themselves abused by others, and alcohol dominate their lives. The plot  is a very intelligently constructed mystery that depends on these women being the way they are, and their struggles to escape their nature. A very satisfying read."
"The only reason I didn't stop reading this book after the first 100 pages is because I kept thinking surely this novel will pick up it's pace at some point.  Not this novel.  Slow moving, very predictable and lame.  The one positive I can say is good character development.  I do not recommend this novel."
"I devoured this book in just a few days, which is rare for me these days, but a sure sign that it was good as I could not put it down. It's got a very Gone Girl-esque feel, and until the last few chapters I was totally in the dark as to how the story was going to end (and I only got an idea as to how it would because I cheated and peeked ahead a few chapters one night). Recommend if you enjoy thrillers and suspense novels!"
"Rachel, an obsessive alcoholic who has blackouts, is struggling with life after divorce and sinking further and further into oblivion.  She becomes involved in a missing person case that she witnesses from a train and the case gradually takes over her life.I was torn between giving this book five stars or one star.  Why?  Because, while it's clever, it was excruciatingly slow to get to the point.  It is told in the first person, in turns, by three women, all s-l-o-w-l-y painting a hazy picture of a puzzle that isn't explained until the very last pages. It was extremely frustrating and a few parts were borderline boring.However, I was fascinated by the author's stream-of-consciousness style even in the present tense, which I usually dislike.  There is virtually no dialogue for the first 30 pages, just rambling thoughts. The pace definitely picked up toward the end and got really exciting.  Then, I was hooked and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to discover the very satisfying conclusion.There is a very small cast of characters, none of whom are very likable, and yet the book held my interest throughout.  Something different."
"OK, I know it's only February, but I read a lot -- usually at least 3 to 6 books per month. I read this novel more slowly than normal, savoring the storyline, the prose, the character development. I found the concept of the storyline original and intriguing, the characters believable, and the ending surprising (so to the reviewer who expressed boredom and disappointment with an obvious conclusion, um, maybe you should be a detective or a mystery writer 'cuzl I so did not see that coming!) I was immediately drawn in and caught up in the story, and stayed up too late reading on more nights than is good for me if I want to keep my job. I found Ms. Harkins's writing entrancing, and even the shifting points of view and jumps back and forth in the chronology didn't bother me; rather they added a dimension of realism to the inevitable unreliability of multiple narratives.I'm not going to rehash the plot yet again. Yes, Rachel is a fall-down blackout lying drunk who's stalking her ex husband. Does that make her unsympathetic or unlikable? Maybe. She's also a disillusioned woman who has never fully dealt with devastating losses in her life. Which probably have contributed to her becoming a fall-down blackout lying drunk. (Yes, I know that's a sentence fragment.) Or, perhaps I just liked her because I used to be a fall-down blackout lying drunk with stalker tendencies. And, I guess the fact that I didn't foresee the ending can be attributed to brain damage from all that alcohol consumption.Anyway, I loved the book and didn't want it to end. I highly recommend it to fans of Gone Girl and The Husband's Secret. If you're an Alfred Hitchcock addict, as I am, I think you'll enjoy this novel."
Hummmmmm. So many with the same title. Confusing and all the back many forth from one character to another.  I read it because of the movie....I like the UK setting and have been on the train...... a bit disappointed in this but stayed with it even though I had it figured out.
"The Girl on the Train is like no other book I have ever read before. Typically I read historical fiction and contemporary romance so this book isn't usually what I would buy but I had heard it was impossible to put down. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the novel even though it was creepy and I felt that nothing quite added up. Something always felt a bit off. The novel had me at the edge of my seat and I finished the second half of the book in one day. I really had a hard time putting it down because the author has a way with storytelling where she ends the chapter with a cliffhanger and I just had to know what happened next. The book switches back and forth between the female narrators and the dates when certain events took place so it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow in the beginning and keep track of where everyone was on the same date but after awhile the dates got closer together and everything came together. The ending was a big surprise to me and I never would've guessed it. Like I said, I don't typically read psychological thrillers but I am glad I took a chance on this one. I highly recommend this novel to everyone, regardless of your preference in literary genres."
"I really enjoyed the way the tale is told from the perspective of the three women. It held my attention while tempting me, consistently, to ponder the next turn and unfold the connections and clues that take the reader round the next corner of the story. After finishing the book I rented the movie and found it to be an awful interpretation."
"Wow! I loved this book and to think that I almost didn't read it. For whatever reason, I had a hard time connecting with the book in the beginning, but kept at it at the insistence of so many friends. I am so glad I did. It was slow at the beginning, but it paid off in the end. The book is told from the point of view of three different women. The unreliable narrator tactic worked well with the way the author told the story from different dates. If you liked Gone Girl you will like this book. I don't see how my review is even necessary or helpful considering how many reviews this amazing book and author already have, but I wanted to share anyway. Once I got into the book, I could not put it down and had to know what would happen next. I guessed who the killer was, but I don't think that means anything. The book is a psychological thriller not a mystery so the suspense comes from wondering if our MC will escape the dangers posed by the villain and not from solving the mystery of who dun it. It was a nail biting experience at the end as I worried for two of the main characters and wondered what would happen. I can't say more without giving it away.If you are one of the few who has not read this book, you simply must read it. Please don't let the slow start put you off. You will see, soon enough that it was worth the wait. This novel is unique and not like any other book out there. It shares many of the same plot techniques and narrative as Gone Girl, but the story is completely different from Gone Girl and from any other book. That's what makes the book such a hit.If you have read this book and loved it like I did, I highly recommend that you read, Peter Swanson's The Kind Worth Killing. It hooks you much quicker and it is every bit as good as The Girl on the Train. Both are at the top of my all time favorite books. You can read my in depth review of The Kind worth Killinghttp://www.melissasugarwrites.com/2015/05/the-kind-worth-killing-review-with.html"
I enjoyed this book. I liked the character development. I did have to go back from time to time to see which character I was reading about and the story was choppy at times but I loved the final chapters and couldn't put it down since I just had to know what was going to happen. I liked the premise of someone on a train fantasizing about the lives of the people they watch daily from a train window. I hope to read more from this author.
"This is an excellent psychological thriller about an alcoholic and her imaginations from riding a train daily.  She gets involved in making up stories about a couple who live on the train route as she longs for her ex-husband who lives on the same street.  As a recovering alcoholic, I found it a little difficult to live through her drunken sprees and blackouts but it all comes together in the end with the unexpected ending. Highly recommend it."
"This novel is written in first-person of three women, which provides the tension and perspective. The premise is engaging, and I was most intrigued by the insight it offers into the struggles of addiction. I have experienced the same cycling and thought patterns that the narrators are subjected to. The author either has been there herself, or is intimately acquainted with such persons.Though the story drags a bit occasionally, it will keep you reading to the end."
"I couldn't put this book down once I really got into it.  I especially liked the last third of the book.  I loved the use of multiple narrators.  The book has inspired me to begin working on my first book.  Of note, I may be guilty of liking the book's style more so than the actual story or characters. Sue me."
"I kept reading hoping that I would get to the end ASAP.  I got tired of all the jumping around with flashbacks and then back to the present as well as jumping from character to character trying to keep them straight.  I just wasn't worth it to me to have spent so much time on such a disappointment.  I believe that there might be some readers who would find the book passable, but i did not."
I have only read about 22% and am so bored I have gone on to another book.  Sorry I bought this book
"Wonderful idea, poorly executed towards the end. I really wanted to like this, but the last half of the book DRAGGED. Maybe one good reveal every 45 minutes (used the audio book). It also started to feel a little messy and disorganized with the jumping perspectives and timelines. 3 stars because while a solid half of the book was annoying, I enjoyed the tail end."
"Let me start by saying, I don't understand the hype of being riveting. Before you get upset, this is not a slam or bad review. I did rate it four stars! This is my honest review and I didn't find it riveting.I did, however, find that it was very well written and intriguing. I was about 3/4 of the way through the book before I something crucial clicked and once it did, it all made sense.It did take me several chapters to realize it was bouncing timeframes. I had gotten really confused until I went back and double checked the dates. Things fell into place better after that.I got quite angry at Rachel but that was the nature of her character. The book elicits most of the correct feelings and moods as it should but I wasn't riveted to it and it took me longer than it should have to read it. The one thing I didn't feel enough of, or any, was dread. There should have been a great deal of dreadful feelings with a sense of foreboding. It just want there for me, maybe I read too many suspense/mystery/thriller novels to truly appreciate this book.Those are my Novel Thoughts, though I can't guarantee a Happily Ever After."
"Pay attention to the chapter titles!  I was completely confused for the first third of the book, but once I understood it not only changed chronological order but also the first person telling the story with each chapter, it all made sense.. .to the point that by the end I almost knew ""who dunnit"".  Overall good story and well written."
"This book was a selection of my book group. It did not particularly interest me but my husband thought it sounded interesting and we like to read together. So we read the Kindle edition which did not have actual page numbers, and used the percent read to keep track of our progress. Somewhere around 80% our persistence to finish the book began to pay off. Both of us are glad to have it finished."
"This is a story of nasty dudes and naive women. I loved it. It’s being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but that’s not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachel’s constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who can’t let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesn’t have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. It’s an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachel’s husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachel’s depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while she’s admiring her and Tom’s sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one I’m not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her “I don’t care about anyone but me” attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time she’s thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megan’s selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didn’t like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. There’s good and bad. It’s a confusing mess and I wasn’t always sure which man I was reading about through these women’s thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.It’s definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasn’t until about seventy percent through that I said, “Ah-ha!” I’m always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasn’t a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, don’t lie and don ‘t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age – it’s a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality – for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There weren’t actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldn’t put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. I’m happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect."
I didn't like this book. Sometimes less is more and it's annoying when a villain explains all their motives before they kill someone. Pretty much how this book ends and it reminded me of a silly scary movie.
"I got off to a slow start, had to re-read the beginning to keep the key characters apart.  The three primary characters are all speaking in first person so at first they were all running together, to me.  But after the first few chapters, it hooked me.  It is a true ""who done it"" - and I was surprised.  Had some theories through the whole book but they were knocked away."
"Just finished reading this amazing thriller. I wanted to read the book before watching the movie and I am so glad that I did. It kept me up several nights past my bedtime because I just couldn't put it down. The story line was amazing and I swear I thought almost every character was the killer at one point or another. Definitely picked my brain. Would totally read another book by this author. It's now on my list of favorites, right up there with Gone Girl!"
"I was contemplating to skip this review. I don’t like to be negative, just because it may not be my cup of tea. In a real life I practice a rule, what I don’t understand, I simply respect, instead of judging it.This is a book review site, and I feel I have to stay true to its purpose.I was very excited to read this book after all the commercial hype about it. I have to admit that I set myself for a real disappointment. I will try to stay constructive and short.CONS:Title - The word ‘girl’ is completely wrong for a divorced thirty something WOMAN.Plot - Predictable, similar concept “Lady on the train” 1945.Characters - Three messed up women, two abusive men. All narrators speak in first person.Ending - Completely flat, fell apart.Pace - First half very slow.PROS:Writing - Paula Hawkins has a unique narrative structure.To me this wasn’t really a mystery, more like a character study. I don’t mind depressing, negative or dark, but non of the characters were likable enough to root for them."
"Fabulous. Long & slow going, actually, but every step of the way hypnotic. The tiny details of human character, that's what pulls you on. These characters at first seem so mundane & ordinary, but what explosions lie within each of them! This whole story is like the peeling of an onion, revealing more and more, until you don't want to look anymore, but are compelled to. Sensational!!"
"I agree with some other reviewers. The characters in this novel were all annoying and not believable.  The main character, Rachel, you just want to reach out and smack some sense into her.  I just keep reading so I could be done with it. It is one crazy female after another, surrounded by awful men. I fail to see why this book is getting so many good reviews. Stay away."
"I still don't get it.  I tried to like this story because it was such a big best seller, but just couldn't get into it and was not at all drawn to any of the characters or their unique situations.  Probably the best part was the end, which exposed a maniacal killer.  I realize the narrative is British, but the author could use some grammar checks."
"It is popular and I was curious. It is interesting as a tour de force in the psychological genre, but I found it diffuse and a bit tedious. I never felt that I cared about any of the characters in the story. The journey I was being led on thus never really captured my imagination. To me, that is a significant failure in plot and character development. Perhaps, it is just not my type."
"Put aside plenty of time to read this book.I am always looking for books that are character driven.  The main protagonist is damaged, broken and an alcoholic.  She is not someone that welcomes warm and fuzzy moments.  Her life has been spiraling out of control for some time.  Her choices and habits come back to bite her on a regular basis.It took a while for me to engage with this character.  As an addict in recovery, this book cause me to squirm quite a bit.  I've lived her story in many ways.  I had to overcome my comfort level to continue to read this book.  I am glad I did.There are so many layers to this book.  It is the proverbial onion, complete with aspects that sting the eyes to near tears.The plot has so many twists and turns.  It is very much like that rollercoaster that you avoid at all costs.  Your friends and family tease you, prod you, yet you steadfastly say never.  Next thing you know, you are on that rollercoaster, unsure the bar across will hold you in.  After wards, you are asked whether you enjoyed it.  With a wry smile, you say quietly, ""Yes, yes I did.""The many reviews of this book may not do it justice.  I suspect the intrepid reader will find within its nooks and crannies a very satisfying read."
"No wonder they made a movie from this book. It was a great story! Characters developed as you turn each page, and the plot was thick with mystery, betrayal, love, heartbreak, murder, and it was an awesome thriller!"
"Interesting, compelling storyline and definitely held my attention to the end.  The characters and their flaws just kept coming but not in a way that detracted but instead pulled you into the story tighter and tighter.  I must admit to feeling exhausted by the time it ended.I can certainly understand why this book was chosen to become a movie."
"While Rachel is not the most sympathetic protagonist (drunks usually aren't) her story is a fascinating one. Interesting approach in this book to weave the viewpoints together of the major participants. Lots of false leads, red herrings, and the self centered perspectives that people often have combine for an interesting mystery and a fascinating read."
Couldn't stop reading<U+200B> it to see how it ended but it was not an enjoyable read. Not one character was likable. Ending not terribly satisfying either.
"I wonder if I was the only person who hoped that Rachel would also at some point, be murdered. She was almost unbearably pathetic and unfortunately without any other strong, likable characters I just found myself whipping through the book so I didn't have to be reading it anymore."
"One of the better ""whodunits"" I've read in recent years.  The economic and social strictures of post-Thatcherian suburbia set the background for this surprisingly powerful novel about a ""girl"" (unemployed) on a ""train"" (daily commuter run) who has little better to do than shuttle back and forth from home to London -- and muse about the life she wished she'd had.  Not fast, but compelling.  The characters are not chock-full of surprises until the very end of the novel, but they are moved along well enough by author Paula Hawkins. Narration and dialog are British, of course, but not so tough as to move us Yanks to the urbandictionary more often than occasionally.If, indeed, you liked the book/movie GONE GIRL you will probably like this one too."
"How does a writer get me to feel empathy for a lying, busy-body, pathetic drunk? Rachel had a nice life in the suburbs until difficulty conceiving drove her to drink—in excess! To the point she lost everything. She’s obsessed with her ex, even though he has moved on with another wife and child. Now she’s become obsessed with a couple she sees from the commuter train. She’s given them names and created a fairy tale life for them. Until the day she sees something that shatters the illusion.This suspense has everything. The characters are well-developed; the pace moves along; there are plot twists throughout. It kept me guessing. This is a hard-to-put-down novel. I didn’t want it to end!"
"Took me a while to adapt to the writer's style, but the story kept me going and I soon got accustomed to the very ""British"" style (and the somewhat anaccronistic setting as the story developed). No wonder it was adapted into a blockbuster motion picture!!"
"Flat, predictable, poorly written. I'd have dropped it midbook (which I almost never do) had it not been part of a book club."
"What I found interesting about The Girl on the Train is that it is told by 3 unreliable female narrators, each of whom is quite unlikeable. In fact, the cast of characters in this book is fairly small and there’s not a likable character in the bunch. Is it weird of me to say that it was almost a relief to not feel like I had to root for anyone? The women all become more sympathetic by the end of the story, but overall it was fun to read a book that I didn’t want to put down without having any emotional ties to any one character.I found this book to be fairly fast-paced and without much extraneous plot that wasn’t related to the mystery. I couldn’t put it down because I just had to know how it ended. Whereas I found myself baffled by the lack of a decisive ending in Gone Girl, this was not the case in The Girl on the Train and I appreciated that a full story was told from start to finish, with no open questions remaining.It’s an intriguing mystery that will be just as good as you pass the time on a cold winter’s night as it will be this summer on the beach."
"Dull, tedious & the ""plot twist"" was yawn-inspiring. Let's just say I wasn't expecting a 300 page diary of a drunk woman."
"I admit it was slow at the start. But once you were caught in the web of the story, there is just no letting go. The layers are exceptional, and the story unpredictable. I really enjoyed this book and in the end couldn't put it down. Absolutely wonderful."
Not bad novel. Wanted to read it before watching the movie. After reading the book don't think I will bother watching the movie. Not my kind of story.
"It took quite an effort to get through it It really draggeedandwas depressing at least half way through it. After reading, I will skip the movie."
"I loved this book, more than I thought I would. Love the multiple narrators with the different perspectives, the swirling revelations that are revealed in an almost rollercoaster fashion. I've missed sleep to read and finish it .that says a lot for me!"

For a debut novel, it was a brilliant depiction of the most basic elements of fallen human nature--envy, greed, lust, deceit, all tied in with murder, emotional and sexual hunger, and obsession on a grander scale.I am thankful to my new favorite author, Paula Hawkins, for:1) Not giving us a Gone Girl ending, especially with all the main characters' aversion to truth. This type of unpredictability suited Gone Girl because of the utter vileness of the ''heroine,""and we know that life never turns out the way we want, and sometimes evil triumphs over good. But I think letting Rachel live and killing off Tom finally gave the reader some breathing room to say, ""Finally. Something goes right."" (Or at least that's what I say, given that I felt like I was reading the book on a fast-paced train with my pulse beating fast and heartbeat ricocheting in my chest.)2)Giving me a character I can relate to. Only instead of alcohol, I'm addicted to caffeine. I felt that Rachel Watson was somewhat of an extension of me. We're both curious, (need to know), we're both driven by a sense of doing what's right (if you see something, say something), although I don't know if I would have had the nerve to do what she did, we've both said our share of ""I'm sorry"" to people we love (after acting similarly), and we're both fat. Instant buddies for sure. Throughout the novel, she makes stupid decisions (just like I do), but I found myself feeling protective of her. I did not want her to meet Megan's fate. So thanks to Ms. Hawkins for giving me a new best friend.3). Writing a book with a potential for changing lives. At the core of this novel is this undeniable theme: We are all only humans. We have our successes, our failures. Our strengths, our weaknesses. We are individually different but together all the same. All of us have hope of redemption. Rachel was an alcoholic until she realized the value of memory over apologizing for things she doesn't remember. Anna liked being the homewrecker until she found out the train wreck her life had become with Tom's infidelity and her ex-nanny's betrayal. For some, redemption was too late. Megan and Tom wanted something they could not obtain in their own lives so they reached out to each other for a temporary pleasure, which inevitably costs them their lives. Though the reality of my life is nowhere nearly that drastic, I can honestly say that I am somewhat changed by the lessons in this novel. It has touched my heart in ways that only truly great literature can.Though I'm sad at the end of this journey and that I have to debark, I hope other readers will get the chance to ride this fast-paced thriller on wheels, accompanied by suspense and page-turning anticipation running through their fingertips."
"The Girl on the Train is yet another twist on the classic whodunit. The story is told through the point of view of three women, each with their own flaws and secrets. We meet Rachel Watson, a drunk, unemployed, divorcee who daydreams about the ""perfect"" life of Jess and Jason - a couple she only knows by seeing them from the train every day. When Jess (Megan Hipwell) turns up missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to solve the case. Through a series of lies and deceit, Rachel finds herself face to face with a cast of male characters (all deeply flawed themselves), anyone of whom could be the killer.My thoughts on the book:The writing style is just horrendous and completely unnecessary. The entire book is written in first person, though our POV switches between the three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. This can lead to confusion when the action flips back and forth. Had this use of first person worked to reveal something about the characters that could just not be said through third-person omniscient, it could have worked. But it was complicated by the fact that each chapter was broken into ""Morning"" and ""Evening"", so the tense switched back and forth between present and past tense. I get that breaking it up this way reflects the two train trips, one in to the city, one back home, but it is unnecessary as most of the action takes place off the train. These two combined makes it difficult to read.This is Hawkins' first novel, and it shows. The bland writing style bored me to death, and it took everything I had in me to finish the book. Stephen King can spend 80% of a book writing about nothing and I love every word of it. Hawkins drew out a boring story where we learn to hate every character involved. Not a single character has a good redeeming quality.I was genuinely surprised when the killer was revealed. I was not shocked, however, and this is a huge negative. When I read the reveal in ""Gone Girl"", I had to put the book down. I could not continue because I had to process what I had just read. I have had this happen in many other books. Good fiction is emotional. You feel shocked because you're so invested in the story and characters. Here, I was just glad it was over.Conclusions:I read this book simply because the movie is coming out soon and it was well known and liked. I was disappointed throughout, and expected much more. There are many things (see above) that could have improved this book. The plot was not bad, it was just poorly developed. The characters were not unbelievable, but they sure were unlikable. The style and prose were atrocious; nothing short of a full rewrite could have saved that.Read at your own risk. If being part of the crowd is more important to you than reading quality fiction, this is your book."
"I was so excited to finally read The Girl on the Train after hearing a plethora of positive reviews from both friends and critics. I love a good psychological thriller, and I hoped this would be no exception. As soon as I started reading the book I was sucked into the story. I couldn't stop turning pages, and I needed to find out what happened. Unfortunately, I guessed the outcome of the novel right from the beginning, and that really detracted from my enjoyment of the story.The Girl on the Train is the story of Rachel, a twenty-something alcoholic who still loves her ex-husband, despite the fact that he cheated on her and dumped her for the other woman. The book opens with Rachel taking the train every day. She makes up stories about the houses the train goes past on the way, and she loves watching a couple she deems as perfect. One day, the woman in the couple is with another man, and Rachel is quite upset about her cheating. The next day Rachel wakes up a mess after a night of drinking. She has very limited memories of her night, but it turns out the woman she watches from the train is now missing, and she is worried she might be connected to her disappearance in some way.The writing in this book is really well done and quite easy to read, too. I think this is a great novel for those of you who are not big readers, or perhaps you are transitioning from young adult to adult books. While the pacing is generally very quick, I did feel a bit bored during the middle of the book, when I felt like the action slowed down a bit. This is especially true, for me, in hindsight. Because I was able to predict the ending of the book right from the start, it rendered most of the novel moot. I felt like the author walked me around in circles when she could have walked me in a straight line.Nonetheless, I really appreciate the plethora of important issues discussed in The Girl on the Train. For example, Rachel's alcoholism stems from her inability to have children. It makes me so frustrated to think of how women are often deemed worthless if they are unable to have children, even in today's society where we are working so hard to achieve equality between the sexes. I felt so sad for Rachel, and wanted her to get help throughout the book. In fact, I really appreciate that all of the characters in The Girl on the Train are so flawed. I've seen many reviews in which readers criticize the author for writing only terrible characters. Yes, many of the characters in this book do horrible and deplorable things, but I see most of them as having redeemable qualities as well. Other important topics discussed in this book are mental illness, the role of women in society, whether you can really know someone, and when, if ever, can we find truth in life.Overall, The Girl on the Train was a fun read, and I'm glad I picked it up due to its popularity and film adaptation. I am a bit disappointed that the big twist at the end was so predictable, and that is the main reason why I am giving this three out of five stars. That being said, I think The Girl on the Train is the perfect book to read with friends because there are so many topics to be discussed. I will definitely check out any other books that Paula Hawkins writes in the future as well, since I did fly through this one!*This review originally posted on Goodreads"
"I was blown away by this psychological thriller, a debut psychological thriller at that! I was fascinated by the idea of this woman secretly spying on residents everyday as she rides the 8:04 train. People watching is fun, I enjoy doing it when I’m forced to be social, but the situation this woman involves herself in is far more complicated, and personal, than she expected. (And something I’m not motivated enough to involve myself with- bye Felicia.)Coming out of a rough divorce, Rachel finds herself at an all time low. She drinks to dull her emotional pain, she rides the train into town without a sense or purpose, and now she finds herself meddling in other’s peoples affairs- literally. As a former resident of Blenheim Road, she’s always watching as she passes by... Until one day, she sees something, within the blink of an eye, that kick starts an investigation she’s stuck in the middle of.Rachel begins her own personal investigation after the police have made it quite clear they won’t be listening to an unstable drunk. The case had me jumping to conclusions after each chapter. I wanted answers and wanted them now. I was desperate to read faster, to unlock another clue that would lead me in the right direction of solving the mystery.Hawkins wrote chapters from alternating points of view, revealing pertinent bits of information at the right moment. The minute I had an inkling on who the perpetrator could have been, something new was thrown into the equation and I’d be back to square one. Mad props on your trickster ways and skills, Paula.One of my favorite things about reading this genre is trying to figure out/solve the mystery before it’s revealed. (Movies, too!) It’s a trait I inherited from my dad. Books I can’t figure out/solve are always enjoyable; whether I’m reading and frantically turning pages as if they’re more important than air, or taking my time to absorb the details and take notes, they engulf me. Sleep is for the weak, I need answers.The Girl on the Train was a nail biter and I was hooked on the story the entire time. I look forward to future works by this author!"
"""My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination...""And with that, Rachel the narrator certainly becomes one of the most unreliable narrators I've ever had the pleasure of reading. There are actually several points of view in 'The Girl on the Train' but Rachel is the main narrator. A sad sack of a woman, she has been recently divorced, fired from her job in London and is losing a nasty battle with the bottle. Because she is often drunk, nothing she says or recalls is trustworthy.I needed a break from my usual contemporary romances and this thriller kept me glued to my Kindle! Rachel sees a ""prefect couple"" from the train every day, and she concocts an elaborate fantasy life for them. Surely they must live a perfect life! Unlike her, they seem to live a charmed life, sitting in their pretty garden every day, sipping coffee together.""I don’t know their names, either, so I had to name them myself. Jason, because he’s handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs. And Jess just goes with Jason, and it goes with her. It fits her, pretty and carefree as she is. They’re a match, they’re a set. They’re happy, I can tell. They’re what I used to be, they’re Tom and me five years ago. They’re what I lost, they’re everything I want to be.""Slowly we realize that in fact NOTHING in this book is as it seems, and Rachel is soon drawn into a frightening situation about which, sadly for her, she has no memory. On top of everything else, Rachel is constantly morose and sad, depressed about the loss of her beloved husband Tom, and begins to drive everyone away who ever cared about her.""Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I’m living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It’s exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you’re not joining in.""Rachel drinks so much that she begins to black out. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife Anna but just can't seem to stop herself.""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""This book takes many twists and turns and nothing at all is at it seems. Just when I thought I knew where the story was going, it veered off into another place entirely. it is smart, perfectly paced and filled with flawed, all-too-human characters. Even though Rachel is COMPLETELY unlikable, I was cheering for her throughout the book.'The Girl on the Train' is smart, clever and surprising. Glad I read it before I saw the movie. Highly recommend!!"
"I admit that I’m no expert when it comes to this genre. In fact, as to date, I have only read three books including this that falls under this category, so I will have to base my review on the general impact of the novel to me to the best of my ability.In my personal opinion, this book passes the mystery-thriller-suspense-crime criteria with flying colors! What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter.It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader’s empathy. Of the three POV’s, I was most glued to that of Rachel’s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot.It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time. I felt like nothing happens so much but at the same time, it also felt like everything is happening and unraveling right under my nose and I couldn’t control my heart from hammering against my chest. There were times I had to stop reading and allow the creeps to surface above my skin."
"Although I understand the process of jumping around on time frames in this book it seemed a little more bewildering than some others I have read. In fact for the first hundred pages I really had a hard time getting into the story because Rachel was so pathetic that she was hard to even root for. This does not mean she was not a well-developed character nor does it mean the book was poorly written. I simply had a hard time identifying with any of the characters and it may be because the author was attempting to use Rachel's black periods as a device to make you question what really happened. About two-thirds of the way through the book I had determined who I believed killed Megan so the only thing left to do was to see who lived who died and who went to jail. The finale of the book was well done and feel true to form. I appreciate the story and I always enjoy a mystery but this book did not grab me as much as some others I have read recently. I still think many people would really enjoy reading the book and of course it would make a wonderful movie as has already been done. I simply believe that there are other books that do suspense better than this one although this is a fun read and I cannot say I was disappointed by it. Some of it just felt like it had been done before and in some cases better. As you can see I still believe it was a 4 out of 5 and therefore worth the time to read. Pardon the grammar, it is difficult to write a review on your cell phone."
"pooled ink Reviews:2.5 StarsObviously I was hyped after watching that thrilling movie trailer and decided I would buy the book and read it before I saw the movie. So I did. And now I’m slightly less inclined to see the movie. (But I’ll probably still go because a) Emily Blunt and b) Ooooo it looks crazy!)The book travels up and down the rails following Rachel’s cyclic battle with alcoholism and her obsession with solving Megan’s case as she continues to tangle her life with those linked to Megan, get incredibly drunk, make embarrassing not-great decisions, realizes what she’s done, decides not to drink for half a second and then downs a bottle or two of wine to drown out her embarrassment and misery only to make more poor decisions. It became wearing to read about it for so many pages. Alcoholism is a real problem, I know that, and I also know that I don’t sound very sympathetic, but that’s why I didn’t go to school to become a therapist.The whole book was pretty consistent…and boring. And the killer? It was obvious. I bet you can guess who it was. And the why? It’s pretty easy to guess as well, at least part of it.It’s not a very long book…but it felt long. It felt like the same stuff over and over again. There was nothing exhilarating, surprising, jolting, unnerving. I felt none of it. The only part I enjoyed was the ending of the book when characters starting changing, clues started showing, and all the little lines began meeting to reveal what happened that Saturday night when Megan went missing.All in all this book is filled with sad people with messed up lives making stupid decisions that only work to further ruin their lives. I was tired of reading about it. I just kept waiting for someone to do something worth applauding, but that didn’t come until the very end.Psychological thriller? I think not. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dull commute that only succeeded in making me snooze as I let the gentle rocking of the train lull me into a stupor. Definitely a story better executed as a movie than a book.Read my FULL review here: [...]"
"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.  The narration dragged along in some parts, but overall it held enough suspense to keep me basically hooked til the end.  Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel."
"Books that garner tons of praise frequently make me suspicious and often disappoint.  As my father's fond of saying: ""just because it's a best seller doesn't mean it's a best reader"" and he's right.  So I ignored this NYT best seller for months but saw that it's being made into a movie and decided to give it a shot.  This is indeed a ""Hitchcockian"" thriller that slowly unwinds and leads to an ending that wraps things up but is a bit unsatisfying...maybe because after all the build up I expected more.  Still, this is one of the more engaging books I've read in awhile and it was hard to put down once I got going.  Alcoholic train commuter Rachel likes to watch out the window going to/from the city and enjoys making up a life for a couple she frequently sees outdoors on their terrace.  Then she witnesses what appears to be infidelity and then someone goes missing but Rachel's frequent alcohol fueled blackouts make her unsure of what she's seen and what she truly knows.  Paula Hawkins freshman novel is a winner and I'd definitely read her next effort."
"Ok, here's the deal. When a person takes the time and puts in the effort to write a book they automatically get at least 3 stars from me. Now, she is a good writer as far as the technical aspects go and she is fine with the creative elements as well, so I push it to 4 stars. However, I just wasn't terribly moved emotionally or mentally in any new way to give her 5 stars. To get 5 stars you really need to go the distance. You really need to stand out above the crowd with originality and creativity. you really need to move me and to shake me and/or alter my perception or change or challenge my way of thinking or something out of the same old same old, even if I don't like a book for other reasons I can give 5 stars if the author pushes my buttons or gets under my skin. This book does not go the distance. However it is a worthy read in a world of mediocrity that we have today because readers want to be catered to like little babies. Readers are few and lazy today. None of them want to really be challenged. Thus what is ok passes for quality because the lame mainstream readers out there demand to not have their boats rocked except moderately. It is the low intelligence of readers that have given us the minimal fare quality of creativity that is written today."
"I thought this was a bad book. The characters are one-dimensional (you can sum up all of them in one or two words) and the plot was pretty predictable and tedious. The characters do the same thing over and over and the dialogue repeats itself (""you have to stop this""). The way the author uses multiple narrators should provide more depth and intrigue than it actually does, since quite often it turns into each character saying more or less the same thing about the same incident.I know this book is a huge hit and now a movie starring the lovely Emily Blunt. I can't say I really know why. However, I did learn that one can buy gin and tonic in a can in the UK. On some things it really does seem like the Brits have things figured out."
Hummmmmm. So many with the same title. Confusing and all the back many forth from one character to another.  I read it because of the movie....I like the UK setting and have been on the train...... a bit disappointed in this but stayed with it even though I had it figured out.
"If you're looking for one of those mystery novels that leaves you in suspense for the sake of loving the characters, then don't read this. Too often, people pass up good novels or, as seen out here, condemn a good work because the characters are either not relatable or not what they wish they could relate too. Paula Hawkins does a great job in presenting a cast of characters that are flawed and present us with a sense of real life depression. Girl on the Train is often compared to Gillian Flynn's novels like Gone Girl. The difference between the two is that Flynn deliberately presents the reader with characters that are the dregs of society living in the bleakest of circumstances. Hawkins is less severe.With Girl on the Train, you get to know the murderer nearly from the first chapter. She cleverly hands the information to the reader and then equally cleverly expects you to dismiss it. And you will. You get to meet the three graces: Rachel, Anna and Megan. Each presents the story from her point of view. Rachel is the main character who's a seriously disturbed alcoholic with blackouts that start the mystery. Oddly, I found Rachel to be the only character worth knowing and caring about and most of that comes from her confusion as to who she is. You meet Megan next who struggles with sexual boundaries, or more likely borderline personality disorder. She's our lovely victim....and you won't care. Then you meet Anna who has supplanted Rachel in the heart of Tom, former husband, for supposedly being a better choice. Some people have suggested that Anna became pregnant and that's why Tom left Rachel but the timeline doesn't fit. Anna, just happens to be the narcissist who warps reality to fit her needs no matter how ridiculous.So with our three graces come all their flaws, a murder, odd characters hovering on the edges and something not quite right seen through Rachel's eyes. Though condemned for her lack of reliability and serious issues with judgment, Rachel actually does some extraordinary things which made me care. I won't say more other than this is worth reading, if you're a deep person and like to explore the possibility of ""what if this were me?"" If not, don't bother."
"I bought this book mainly because it had been #1 NYTimes best-seller.  Big mistake.  I regret the time I wasted reading it.The vast majority of the plot energy centers around the female protagonists triumphantly discovering, verifying, agonizing over, and obsessing over the infidelity of their husbands. There is not one word about any attempts to solve problems or make a better marriage. There is not one word about the good side of any marriage.. On the contrary,If this bleep is to be believed, the only propose of marriage is lose-lose to give e the wife cause to feel bigtime aggrieved.  If that were the case, women's best course would always be to avoid marriage altogetherThat said, Hawkins weaves  in a powerful and non-preachy.anti-alcohol subtext.  If this book saves one young woman from life-destroying ravages of drink, that would be terrific.  But a good read it is not."
"First off, I think there is somewhat of a ""herd"" mentality in the overall negative ratings by some reviewers of this book. With that off my mind...I see real value in the epiphanies each of the three female characters experienced within the unfolding of the story.Rachel literally rides the train and, to my interpretation, is  also, figuratively riding the train of alcoholism leading to some serious self delusion. She blames the failure of her marriage entirely on herself and carries the burden of the resultant guilt. She never saw her husband clearly. While riding the train into London everyday she invests emotional attachment to a young couple she observes in a house she passes everyday...so much so... she bestows upon them her own made-up names. Events in her own life and in the lives she is observing conspire to literally and figuratively make her get off the train. These events are suspenseful and make for a great storyline. Both Anna and Megan each have different self discoveries. The male characters do not seem to evolve and if anything, each one you meet shares culpability in the main event of the book.  Particularly odious to me (and he is written to actually smell bad) is Scott for his hyper aggressive selfish character; his bullying and his assault of Rachel. Just a personal observation and opinion.Careful reading of this book will yield many clever literary devices. The fact that there is not one smile described as genuine from joy at its root in the whole book.""Everything about him is warm—his hands, his eyes, his voice—everything but the smile. You can see the killer in him when he shows his teeth.""Another is the symbolism behind the small pile of rocks in the corner of Megan and Scott's garden.It is not written as an intense suspense narrative with accelerated pacing and should not be compared with such.  It is written more like a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces to the puzzle locked inside the seemingly blackout mind of the ""Girl on the Train"".  For a satisfying literary and emotional experience and challenge, I highly recommend this book."
"I picked up this book because I saw previews for the movie coming out. With it coming out soon, I burned through the book in a couple of sittings to keep it fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good read for me. The quality of writing is perfectly fine – never felt confused about what the author was trying to convey. The plot leaves a little to be desired. I think my liking of the book is somewhere between “its okay” and “I like it”. My main issues with the story are as follows:1. The book doesn’t really get into the meat of the story until about halfway. I kept waiting for something to happen but it always seemed to be coming eventually.2. The book is only told from the POV of the women – Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Tom, Scott, and to a lesser extent Megan’s shrink, do not get a chapter to themselves. I assume this is done because if they had, there would be no mystery. I’m not sure if this is lazy writing, but it certainly makes the narrative a little biased.3. The author spends the entire book basically saying that the killer can’t possibly be a certain character and then at the end of the book – SURPRISE! – it is. That is not really a twist by my definition.4. When you do find out who the killer is, everything wraps up in the last 20 pages and the story is over. I wasn’t expecting any sort of slasher killer fake ending with the murderer constantly popping up, but after the reveal the book just rockets to the end and doesn’t let anything sink in for the reader.Despite the issues I had, I still enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it. It is interesting to read from Rachel’s POV because you can see her mind unravel at times and you can’t trust some things she says. Give it a read, or maybe just check out the movie, but don’t expect it to change your life."
"I have mixed feelings about this book. It was good, but it wasn't quite as good as I expected based on all the hype. The writing style was pretty straight forward and simple. In many people's opinion, simple writing is better and it certainly stayed away from the purple prose. So it points for that. Still it wasn't beautifully written. The story was told from the viewpoint of three female characters and it is a murder mystery sort of novel. Much of the book deals with characters reflecting back while not being able to piece together who committed the murder. The book isn't very long and is a book that someone can read fairly quickly. I like books that I can read in a night, so this is a plus to me. At times it felt like the book was dragging though as it kind of left us wondering without much movement in the plot. Since the main event already happened, there was a lot of /waiting to find out/ about the storyline. The main character (the girl on the train) was a decent character.  Rachel is an alcoholic with blackouts, an inability to have children and at her core a heart of gold. The story was also written from the viewpoint of Anna, the more slender, more beautiful and more fertile girl who hooked up with Rachel's husband while they were still married and later married him herself. Anna is sort of the typical /bitchy other woman/ who eventually admits that didn't really care that she taking a married man. The story was also told from the viewpoint of a the pretty blonde Megan who cheats on her husband and has a troubled past. The female characters were interesting. The book goes into the nature of a manipulative relationships and could be a helpful read to woman who have gone through domestic violence or tend to fall for bad guys."
"I had added ""Girl On a Train"" to my summer reading list, and was anxious to start it.  It was high on my list - right after Orphan Train and All the Light We Cannot See. I had no preconceived ideas about it and did not know the story line. Given the number of great reviews, I was pretty shocked when I was halfway through it and simply not engaged. I could have put it down and not returned to it. I get the theme of ""these-characters-aren't-who-you-think-they-are"", but how many chapters of the main character's obsessive screw ups, alcoholism, mental instability,  and self-loathing do we need to witness before thinking the author doubts our comprehension and needs to repeat it for us?For awhile, the most interesting part for me was the momentary supposition that Megan and Rachel were the same person due to MPD - at the same time knowing the impossibility of that considering the cross-over of people in both their lives. By the time the author fleshed out Meghan's background issues - I just didn't care. It had taken too long and I just didn't care to pick up the [new] baggage of Meghan's self-loathing after spending half the book watching Rachel embrace her pathetic-ness.I don't know if one would consider it a ""disclaimer"" but I have a degree in Criminology, so I may be more pragmatic in my attitude. I read a lot of mystery/thrillers and feel I am easily engaged and don't tend to over criticize.With that said, (and trying to avoid spoilers) - I thought the perpetrator was obvious early on, based on actions and history......not conversation and pretenses.  And come on - the ""nanny scenario??""  Seriously""Normally, in a thriller or mystery I really like - the characters are woven with a complexity that involves me. Later on, it should be a surprise regarding who they really are. Quite simply - I didn't want to know any of these people."
"Whenever each of us reads a book, consciously - or unconsciously -  our reactions to the story, the characters, the writing  all affected by what we  to the story. My own reading experience was quite disturbing, so much so that the psychological, emotional abuse of my past marriage was triggered in ways that stunned and frightened me.  Proust was either lucky or fanciful with the charming memories triggered by his famous madeleine cookies.  This novel is suspenseful and fast paced.  It is also a subtle and complex story about women -  women's experiences and desires within the context of Western culture: how women live with men - or ,in this story, a man - about how we come to believe ""truths"" about ourselves.  The story can be read in many ways: suspenseful murder mystery; fast paced psychological mystery; and also as a story about a complex main character -  weak  and unlikeable when first introduced - and her relationships within the other women's stories.  As this tale is unwoven by the author, we find the main character caught up in a plausible tale about the fallout from lies and the (too often invisible) psychological and emotional abuse women endure silently, frequently without self-awareness, leaving these characters with few skills to ""see"" the truth.  Highly recommend."
"It's been a long time since I've been able to finish a book because the author seems to lose me in the middle--if not at the beginning. This one though, kept me hooked til the end! Can't wait to see the movie, by I can't imagine it topping the book."
This is my first read from this author. It was an awesome book! The story kept me in suspense until the very last page. It was completely unpredictable. Can't wait to see the movie coming out Oct 7th!
"Great suspense story, slightly better than the movie.  It is now a movie which I found a little confusing on the characters.  I believe the book helps clarify the ambigusness."
"I was very disappointed. I read the reviews and thought from the ratings this was a safe bet. After completing the long and dreary story I felt the reviewers who believed this to be a great thriller really haven't read one. Sorry, but this story did nothing for me except wear me out. Very repetitive..."
"Knock off of, ""Gone Girl,"" except not as good. The description of the book sounded so good! And it got such great reviews. The book was written okay, however I couldn't invest myself in the characters and was often confused as I often felt like I missed something because information was left out. The main character isn't likeable which made the book even worse. Waste of time."
"This book proved to be aggravating, confusing, and frustrating, but also riveting, enjoyable, suspenseful, and enticing; well worth the time and effort. I recommend this highly. It is a book that requires you to question everything. It kept me guessing for a long time."
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. The story is engaging and the writing is excellent taking the reader on a train ride to an exciting and thrilling conclusion leaving the reader will a hopeful outlook for Rachel and Anna.
"I tried to read it twice. It was not enjoyable. Frustrating, couldn't follow her. I wonder if the girl had dual personalities. maybe."
The book has a good start.  But 3/4 of the way into the book I knew where it was headed. The ending was so/so
"AMAZING read! I was looking for a good ""grabber"" book - one that you start reading and it pulls you in - and I found it with the Girl on the Train! I think of this as a combo of Gone Girl and The Husband's Secret. Both great reads, adding this one to my recommendation list."
"Very poorly written, confusing, and literally a waste of my time.  Difficult to distinguish individual characters in the story.  So bad that I continued to read in hopes that it had to improve .... did not."
"Couldn't put it down, however I was hoping for something a little more compelling toward the end. The fact that all three women were somewhat submissive and weak made me feel some sort of way."
"After seeing over 50,000 good reviews, I thought I would love this book. I didn't. I read a lot of books and I give out a lot of recommendations. I do not recommend this one."
"Took this book on vacation, and couldn't put it down until I finished it. Seldom does one get a mystery / thriller with action on every page, with engaging dialog on the non-physical chapters. Loved the book!"
"""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent read! I love it when I don't see the twists coming, and this novel is full consists of twists and a totally unexpected ending! If you're a fan of ""Gone Girl"" you will love this novel!"
"Rachel Watson lives a sad life. Her marriage fell apart, she drinks, and fantasized about a ""perfect couple"" she sees on her train ride. But this couple is not perfect as she thought. If you love, Gone Girl, you will enjoy the twist in this book."
"As much as the book was interesting, I have to say I just really didn't like it."
This was a great story though some parts are hard to read. The construction of the story keeps things interesting and makes for a quick read.  Good characters and a good twist at the end.
Clearly a great read. Looking for something that resembles another book? Gone Girl? I would recommend this to the Gone Girl fan or anyone that wants to have a treat for the eyes to read..!
All the hype on this book this year that perhaps that created my disappointment. Though good and finally half way thru it did grab my interest. Yet still a let down.
More about girl talk and alcohol and less about suspense! It became boring and I lost interest. It was easy to know who killed Megan.
This book was just the right combination of thrilling and reality.  I loved the sub plots of the characters as the narration shifted.  The characters are relatable and the story moves at a nice place.  I will be reading more by this author.
Took some time to untangle characters and story line but was a good read.
"It was a bit short and too fast. But the suspense was well worth it!  I found the characters well narrated during their own POV as well, the surroundings descriptive."
"Interesting style but used to the point of the story being over-written, over complicated, and self indulgent."
"It was an engaging read.  Not fabulous in terms of literary ability or even plot, but it kept me reading until the end."
"I see a lot of bad reviews but I don't know why, this was a great book! I decided i would read the book before watching the movie and I'm glad I did. The book was WAY better! This is a real page turner, I could have read it in one day if I wasn't so busy!"
"I love a good mystery. I really can't remember one like this of all the hundreds I've read that used alcohol and alcoholism in this way. I thought the merger of this and also the conflicting  relationships secrets people hide and also find out about people they never suspected was very intriguing. I did guess correctly but did have my doubts and second guessed myself due to the creative writing and the excellent drama created. I would highly recommend this book. I also listened to a portion of it and loved the main character's narrator. The other one was good for that person, as well. But I am so glad she wasn't the main reader and was that way for a reason because when people talk like that for a whole story I just start to feel extremely awful. As in bored and anxiously so.The subject of domestic abusive was dealt with relatively well. Some really enlightening segments, which is always good."
Actually liked the movie better.  I think movie did a better job of explaining how rachel didn't remember the past because of all the lies she was told.
"Absolutely captivates the reader into the story, submerged in intense emotional angst of multiple characters which initially seems entwined only within the imagination of a single soul.  Absolute must read."
"I'm not understanding why this is getting such high reviews, let alone made into a movie - a train wreck of a book, where is the editing?  It starts off okay but towards the middle there's so much repetition that a good 50+ pages could have been cut out that would have improved the story.  The girl on the train, Rachel, is an alcoholic and watches a couple on her commute who live on the same street she previously did with her ex husband.  When the woman in the couple goes missing she tries to figure out what happened, and if she was nearby that night due to her continued stalking of her ex hubby.  We get repeated mentions of:- let's call my hubby to help me remember (3-4 times), or just showing up on the street multiple times- going to the underpass beneath the train tracks (3x or so)- trying to find another commuter who interacted with her that night (3-4 times)- trying to contact the husband of the missing women, stalking him tooIt improves toward the end, when we finally don't have the repeated chapters over and over again. The characters were all unlikable, with Rachel being one of the most annoying ever created - found myself almost wishing something would happen to her."
"Based on the numerous positive reviews, I was all ready to thoroughly enjoy this book.  The reviews imply plot-twists and edge-of-your-seat reading.  However, I found myself continuing to read for one simple reason:  I was waiting for the big twist or turn or to be completely thrown.  It never came.  I surmised the major plot twist about 1/3 of the way through the book, but kept thinking I might be missing something.  I wasn't.  As other reviewers have stated, the characters are mildly likeable but tend to border more on the annoying.  Their lives, as described by the three various narrators, were uninteresting.  There were many parts of the narrations that could have gone in a compelling direction and would draw you in, but those tangents were often simple, short and left you feeling as if the book was written simple to get to the end.  It was an okay read - definitely a sit by the beach to read the mundane type of book."
"Interesting premise, decent execution. A refreshing change to have 3 main female protagonists who all have warts (although nothing in comparison to the males). The ""multiple viewpoint first person"" narrative (I'm sure there's a more technical literary name for this) is an interesting conceit but a bit confusing at first. In my view, the  story could have been told just as effectively by only two of the 3 narrators. Also one thing that gets missed in this format is any broader descriptive detail and explicit point of view on the evolution of modern British suburban society that lends itself to the rise of twits like these people (since only one of the 3 female narrators --and none of their 2 dimensional male counterparts--will admit to being twits as part of their narrative)The story itself could actually take place anywhere; needn't have been the Home Counties in the UK. However, compared to the mindlessness of the post-yuppie suburban twits we have in the US, these UK versions are pretty soft-edged, maybe even tolerable neighbors. Maybe I'll emigrate.The intersection of the personal narrative of the ""main"" protagonist and the mystery she's drawn into means there are inevitable missed turns on the plot roadmap. At one point I was flipping back through earlier pages thinking I'd either missed something or had inherited the heroine's propensity for drunken blackouts. Had this been a movie we would've commented ""hmmm, guess the last half of THAT plot line ended up on the cutting room floor.""All that aside, this was a decent read and a good diversion. I look forward to reading her next effort. also look forward to what I assume will be the inevitable film version of ""girl on a train"", which I think could actually rectify some of the plotting and narrative blind spots of the book. ) This book is being marketed as ""the next Gone Girl"", but in the right hands, I think a film version of this book could be so much stronger than Gone girl, which I thought had all the predictability of ritual Kabuki theater but with a suspenseful soundtrack."
"I was looking for another great thriller after loving Gone Girl, and since this was just released as a feature film I wanted to read the book before I see the movie. Unfortunately I did not feel that it lived up the hype. Not a single one of the characters is very likeable, so it's hard to care about what about happens to them, or feel invested in the story. For a split second (about 3/4 of the way through the book), it got interesting and the mystery started to feel intriguing, but after all the build-up the final few chapters flew by fairly predictably.There is a lot of flipping back and forth between the characters telling the story, which was kind of similar to Gone Girl, but each section is written in the same style so it doesn't really seem like you're reading another person's perspective. And each section is dated, again copied from Gone Girl, but many of them are out of sequence so I found myself flipping back several times to figure out the timeline.All in all, it was just okay. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. And I don't have much of a desire to see the movie anymore."
"I'm not sure how many stars to give this book.  It is ""very British"" meaning not an American voice, references that resonate with UK citizens made me look up words.Perhaps the fact that I am American, pragmatically American, I did not connect with any of the characters. Not even the baby was described in a way that made me smile; whining, grizzing, no cooing or cuddles really.The characters are self involved and yet not evolved as human beings, which, I suppose is usually the case.The mystery is very good.  It is a true twisting tale of human craziness.  Maybe like the classic Of Human Bondage.Upon reading the last page, I felt sad, not hopeful. I don't think that the character arc was complete but as this is a mystery,perhaps it is keeping in its kind.The other thing that I thought was,""this author is messed up."". But I am middle aged, not raised in the cable tv extremes that millennials, etc have been inured to since birth.  The way that it s written is new, the myriads of relationships:ancient.This book is timeless and brutal, perhaps in the end, there is hope."
"I read this book with my book club. I was intrigued by the promise of unreliable narrators, because they are a weakness of mine. If you don't care for those, or feel cheated or lied to when you read that sort of thing, you'll want to skip this one. I was also interested by people comparing the author to Gillian Flynn. There are definite similarities. I think if you like one,  you'll like the other.I suppose this book would be considered a psychological thriller, Or a murder mystery, but I'm not very good at identifying the right categories for these things. I do recall, after years of watching shows like Bones and Monk, that you can identify the killer by spotting the unnecessary character. In those TV shows, that always works. In this book, I thought I had done that, but it turned out I was wrong. And I was pleased by the red herring. Again, unreliable narrators make that difficult to find. So, don't expect this to be easy to figure out right away.The story is very dark. I think it manages to be less dark than Gillian Flynn's books, but not by much. There are three narrators. Rachel is who I would consider to be the main character. She is a divorcee with a drinking problem, prone to drunken blackouts, unable to remember what happens during them. She's also one of the only likable characters in the book. With all of her flaws she still manages to be sympathetic. It can be hard for the reader not to root for her, even while cringing at a lot of her choices.The book was engaging from the very beginning, with the story drawing you in and keeping you there, because you'll want to know what happens next. I highly recommend it.  Thoughts of a nerdy feminist read"
"I have to say that it was a wonderful book. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. I didn't try to think ahead I just went with the flow as I believe the author wished for me. People in reviews said the were confused but that shouldn't have been necessary. After a few pages you get them etched in your mind so vividly. I am 70 so my memory really isn't that good, so at first I wrote the characters names down and a bit of a description of them. I referred to it after I was forced to put my book down and do some dang work. I would quickly review my notes and just like that I was back into my story. ( I. Loved. Every. Moment. Of. This. Book.)  Any resemblance to Gone Girl is silly. That book had a stupid ending.  I don't have a single complaint about the story. I do have a complaint about the people here telling too many details about the story. I stayed away on purpose because I knew they would ruin the story for me.Paula, you wrote a fabulous story and it was way more satisfying than Gone Girl could have hoped to have been. I will miss the thrill of having this book to read.................what am I going to do with myself. Any book I pick up will pale in comparison!!"
"It’s hard to be objective about a novel that strives so determinedly (and successfully) to make its characters as unlikable as those in Paula Hawkins’ bestselling mystery, “The Girl On the Train”. With not one, but three, unreliable narrators jumping back and forth in time offering first-person perspectives on unfolding events, the book chronicles the intertwined stories of sad-sack drunkard, Rachel, the titular girl on the train; Megan, the secretive blonde half of a seemingly perfect couple Rachel spies on from the train; and Anna, a hard-edged suburbanite who envisions herself as the perfect wife and mother.The central mystery begins when one of the women goes missing.The main narrative, necessarily, comes from Rachel, still wallowing in booze and self-pity years after her husband left her for the younger, prettier Anna. In fact, Anna, the usurper, and Rachel’s ex-husband are still living in the same house that once belonged to Rachel. Having lost her job due to drunkenness, Rachel still takes the train each day from the suburbs into London, not only to make her sober-minded roommate think she’s still gainfully employed, but also to keep an eye on her ex and the woman occupying her old home; the train just happens to pass right by the place. A few doors down lives a beautiful young couple whom Rachel also watches, becoming a little too fascinated by their lives lived largely out in the back yard and through open windows. Although Rachel nicknames them Jess and Jason and envies what she perceives to be their idyllic wedded bliss, it soon becomes apparent that appearances are deceiving, especially after she witnesses a shocking act that shakes up her vicarious fantasy life. But, did she, in fact, see what she thought she saw? Rachel’s reality is blurred from heavy drinking which often results in blackouts; her problems are compounded by her stalking of not only her ex-husband, Tom, and his increasingly agitated wife, but of Scott and Megan, the real-life “lovebirds” Rachel knows as Jess and Jason. What follows is a harrowing, sometimes confusing yarn that allows for no “good guys” and sees Rachel making one misstep after another after another until finally, I lost patience with her to the point that I found it difficult to finish the book. A main character doesn’t necessarily have to be likable, or even relatable, to maintain a good story but they should offer up something—sympathy, grudging admiration, even hatred—to keep the reader hooked in to that character, to want to know what happens to him or her. Rachel used up what sympathy I had for her very quickly, and while I didn’t like her at all, I didn’t dislike her enough by the end to care what happened to her. By the time she finally rallies from her downtrodden hangdog state, it was too little, too late; I simply didn’t care. However, being very familiar with the behavior of alcoholics, I did find Rachel’s behavior to be believable (for the most part), if tiring.The character of Megan was more interesting, and perhaps, more sympathetic. With dark secrets in both her past and present, Megan is a well-structured character who is damaged and self-destructive, not a nice woman but not someone who is intentionally cruel. Her own missteps, more dramatic than Rachel’s (at least early on), are poignant and truly heartbreaking, and while the character of Rachel is the protagonist of the story, it is Megan who really drives it.Anna, the third voice in “Girl On the Train”, is probably the least developed of the three narrators. Presented as a vain, calculating homewrecker whose deeds are doubling back on her, Anna is something of a narcissist, who is, understandably, at the end of her rope with Rachel and her attendant drama. Anna considers herself to be clear-headed and sane compared to the other female characters in the novel, although her narcissism precludes her from seeing that she’s as deluded as they are.The problem I found with having three narrators is that their voices begin to seem strangely similar as one chapter featuring Anna flows into the next chapter, narrated by Rachel, and so on. If Rachel isn’t on a drunken binge, it’s difficult to separate her musings from those of Anna; in more than one instance, I found myself thumbing back to the beginning of a chapter to see if it was titled “Rachel”, “Anna” or “Megan”.The men in the story are also difficult to separate in some instances, and even more sketchily written than Anna. Tom, Anna’s husband and Rachel’s ex, is very much like Scott, Megan’s husband, and neither seems to be all that distinctive. There’s also a shady psychiatrist on hand who doesn’t seem to balk at bedding his patients, and a couple of cops who never come to life, existing merely as words on a page. Of course, they’re an awkward necessity in moving the story forward (and in offending Rachel).Also awkward is the fact that characters narrate events in the present, often simultaneously with a different character in the following chapter, while another character narrates events from months, or years, earlier. Again, it’s a necessity in moving the story forward (and in tying up all the loose ends) but it feels awkward. The solution to the mystery, when it comes, isn’t surprising but it is serviceable and doesn’t insult the reader’s intelligence.As trying as I often felt “The Girl On the Train” to be, it does offer up some suspense, and isn’t altogether horrible. Paula Hawkins writes well and I hope she’ll up her game on her next literary outing."
"Maybe it's because I've read so many books of this type, but I found the story to be predictable, and the ending was not a surprise for me.Additionally, I did not find the characters to be all that likable.  Rachael comes across as a sloth.  Megan reads as a self-centered, conniving, bish, although she has a revelation of such profound and utter sadness that my heart sank to the pit of my stomach for several hours (getting into a book brings the characters alive for me; they are temporarily people that 'I know').  Anna both revels in gloating satisfaction and plays the weak victim at the same time.  Cathy is a roommate with a level of patience that doesn't seem believable.  Tom and Scott, even when they aren't doing anything 'wrong', both seem like condescending jerks to me.I feel like I am 'supposed' to like this book, because someone liked it well enough to turn it into a major motion picture, but I can't quite give it a glowing review.I will say that the author did a decent job of keeping the twists and turns easy enough to follow.  The story was 'okay'.  I'm glad I read it, but it didn't stand out as a read above the rest."
"The reader becomes a voyeur into the life of a voyeur. The characters in this book are definitely out of the norm (I hope), each with some serious problems and some extreme behaviors. There is an air of mystery as I was almost reluctantly drawn into the story, wanting to know more about these creepy people and to learn what had actually happened to them, as the story unfolds from different perspectives. It would be impossible to lump any character into a category of either ""good"" or ""bad,"" as (with all humans) each is a complex combination of both. All seem to be in need of a trusted friend,partner and/or counselor. But wait! These needs are being met by those types of people throughout the book - or are they? Is anyone truly worthy of trust? (Note: The sex and violence is not explicit.)"
"Really having a hard time getting into,this!!! I usually canjumpy around in books ...not this for some reasonDid not see movie yet"
"How boring and cliche. These days, the hand that rocks the publishing cradle is the extra money in the bank just about anyone who is on the bestseller list has to drink coffee at bourgeois cafes whilst waiting for heir manuscript to be picked up and published. Barf."
"I usually read thrillers , suspense, fast-paced who done-it's. Even though this was different somehow, it was still a great read. A page-turner. Love the style this book was written. Anxiously look forward to the next!"
So many twists and turns it's hard to keep them straight. None of the characters in this book are particularly likeable or sympathetic but I could not put it down.
"I had high hopes for this book, however I was very disappointed with the way characters developed and how some parts of the book that were made to seem important were never brought back up. I would not recommend."
"I read the bulk of this book in one day, because I couldn't put it down.I had known beforehand, from reading other people's reviews, that all of the characters were going to be loathsome and unreliable-- This is true and still, I think it adds to the story. You never know who to trust and you have to take each character's story with a grain of salt. For me that made the mystery more fun, like I was a third detective in the novel trying to figure out the puzzle.I guessed who the killer was about 2/3's of the way through the book but feeling like I had solved the case didn't ruin the unfolding of the rest of the story for me. There was still enough doubt in the back of my mind that took me through to the end.This was a fast-paced read that had a lot of twists and turns. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more mysteries like this in the future."
"A really good Psychological thriller. About an alcoholic that thinks she knows what happens to a married woman that comes up missing. But, she was drunk and can't be sure. Hawkins does a great job of weaving in each of the main characters to the story.An ex-husband his new wife and child, another married man who's wife comes up missing and that the main character thinks she may have feeling for him. And this kind, gentle and mysterious Doctor. The one the missing wife is seeing. So what happen? where is she? and who did it?"
This read was not the type of book I usually read. It was exciting near the end. A little slow in the beginning. It did keep you guessing.
Enjoyed reading this book.  Lots of interesting characters and unexpected turns.  I can't wait for the movie to come out and see how it plays out on screen.
"Reading the ""girl on the train"" was intriguing to say the least, seeing someone go through life believing that they are no good until they found out things were not what they seem to be. Now take Rachel for instant, going around letting everyone think she had a job, traveling on a train every single day, just to keep herself amused not sure; however she got herself into something that led to her finding out the man she married was pure evil and would go as far as killing someone to keep his secret. This was a good thriller to say the least, pretty good read."
"The novel pulled me into its sinister plot by the second chapter.  It twisted and turned and then twisted again, finally spitting me out at the end.  A most enjoyable read."
Enjoyed the book and I plan on watching the movie. Books are usually better than the movies by far hope I'm not disappointed.
"What an unfolding... Gripping, turning, a master story telling. You will not be able to put it down! Incredibly powerful"
I just finished it...Want a book you can't put down? Read This!!!I have not had a great book to read in a long time.
"heard this book was good so I'm giving it a good review , I just started reading it and so fat it has a good story line ."
"Really enjoyed this book.  Hard to put down .  Rich characters.  Suspenseful.  Kept me guessing for two thirds of the book and still had doubt till the final reveal.  If you like Gone Girl, give this a try."
The story around the main character is rather despairing at times even though she becomes the heroine in the end. Did not keep the book in my library after reading. Gave it away to the library.
"I found myself wanting to be able to put things aside in order to get back to reading this book. I wanted to know more about the characters, and found myself suspecting each one in turn. I didn't want to put this one down."
Great book with well developed characters. I wish there was one male that could have been a role model.  It's almost like the person who wrote it sees all men as cruel and uncaring of women.
"What a great read! I couldn't put it down, didn't want to! So many twists and turns with quite a surprise ending! A wonderful murder mystery!!!"
"I did not go and see the movie because I  wanted to read the book and I 'my glad I did.  There is nothing like the images of the characters and the settings in your own mind to carry you through the story.  Despite  knowing that Emily Blount played the lead, I  was able to image Rachel in another way.  And, unfortunately, in my opinion, despite Ms. Blount being very attractive, I don't  believe from what I saw from the trailer, she could have accurately portrayed Rachel totally.  However, what I enjoyed about this author's style is that she captured what I feel  is essential to writing mysteries:  make every word and story element count!!  The reader wants to collect information about people, places and things.  We don't like unnecessary story angles that go on and on or ridiculous love stories that have no bearing on the case.  The odd red herring or sexual tension here or there is fine, but be about the story or we lose interest and on to the bookshelf or to the yard sale you go."
I was so disappointed in this book; I had heard rave reviews about it was excited to start reading.  By the fourth chapter I had already mentally checked out and felt the characters were extremely transparent and Rachel's character was exhausting.  It read like a hurriedly written young-adult novel.  Not sure who is giving this book five stars but I wouldn't even give it one unless Amazon told me I had to pick at least a star to write a review.
"I do find myself agreeing with several other readers that the main character was a touch difficult to connect with. At least at first.As the story unfolded and the end grew ever closer, it became clear why she'd fallen into her drinking habits and why her life was such a mess.However, I will say that if you've spent as much time reading these sorts of thrillers and studying them as I have, you may not be quite as shocked at the big reveal as others. I had it figured out several chapters ahead of time, but reading the characters reactions was still enjoyable.Overall, a fairly decent thriller!"
This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The movie makers had to introduce another whole character to explain the plot in this book. I can't believe it was on the NY Times Best Seller list.  That doesn't say much for the NY Times.
"predictable plot, I accurately selected the killer while only 50% through the book. Waited to maybe be surprised or be proven wrong - nope :( ..... everything as I suspected. Not very mind stimulating mystery story. If you have nothing to read at the moment go for it, but have very low expectations. Because of simple scenario and easy to read characters I do not see how they will make a good movie out of it."
"This is the story of three awful women.  If they formed a support group and if support groups had mottoes, I suggest that theirs would be “I needed this, so I gave myself permission to take it.”  And what do awful women end up with if not awful husbands and boyfriends?This novel is in epistolary form, except that chapters are in the form of morning and evening diary entries instead of letters.  In addition, the chapters aren’t in chronological order.  So one woman’s narrative is followed in the next chapter by another woman’s narrative from a year earlier.  It was a little confusing at first, but it wasn’t hard to get the hang of it.Rachel, the protagonist, is the most well-developed and interesting character.  In addition, the scenes are sketchy.  But in every other respect, what the writer does for the beginning two-thirds of the book, exhibits a mastery of detail and pacing, particularly in Rachel’s narrative as she makes her way in these urban and suburban settings.  These chapters have fine literary qualities, enticing the reader to continue.However, the writer doesn't smoothly integrate this literary first part of the novel with the overall detective mystery orientation.  The last third of the book (the “caboose”, let’s say) becomes a regular mystery story, written in more of a mass-market paperback style, but the first part makes it all worthwhile.As we gradually discover more and more about Rachel, some readers might find it depressing.  Without giving too much away, here’s something to help you hang in there.  Rachel’s second worst vice, her lack of respect for boundaries, is what keeps her from succumbing to her worst and most deadly vice.This is not a good gift for the younger kids.  There’s cursing, gruesome violence andheavy drinking.2.88 stars"
"I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting..."
"I'm not certain why this book has been compared to Gone, Girl.  To me, it was written very differently and outside of a woman being missing and the husband being a suspect, they weren't anything alike in my opinion.This book was picked by my book club and I had a hard time finishing it.  My problem was that I disliked each and every character, but especially the main character, Rachel.  She is a person who makes the same decisions to drink, black out, then wakes up confused but knowing she's ""done something bad"".  She phones her ex husband on a regular basis, drunk, crying and/or  harassing he and his wife; she sponges off her roommate who for some reason puts up with her drinking and passing out constantly.  Rachel goes through a repetitious cycle of drinking, blacking out and waking up knowing she has ""done something bad"".  The thing is, she makes the same decisions over and over.  I wanted to personally slap her midway through the story and thereafter.  I nearly stopped reading it several times.I could barely get through this book and the only reason I finished it was to find out what actually happened to the missing woman.  Other than that, save your money and get it from the library if you can take reading about characters who are the weakest people you'll ever meet."
"I wish I liked this one more. It is an interesting concept with the alternating chapters between characters, the vague narration, the mystery of a woman's disappearance, the train travel. But for me the good parts did not outweigh the boring or less than stellar parts.My feelings in short: Engaging beginning, boring middle, exciting ending.My main problems were:1. Writing style. It was waaaaaaay too much internal dialogue. Some is totally okay. We all think in our heads or talk to ourselves. But I hate excessive internal dialogue, and in the case of this story it was a lot. So for me, this was a major issue. Now, if you like internal dialogue, you may very well love this book. But I personally need more character interactions; more showing, less telling, please.2. Characters. I also didn't like any of these characters, except for Rachel's roommate (who was dismissed for being nice). Rachel, Anna, and Megan are the narrators, and I found my interest in them waning. Having an alcoholic for a main narrator was interesting to start, then super annoying. Tom and Scott were no better. These people all had issues galore, which usually makes for an intriguing read. But unfortunately, even with their issues, I lost my interest in them.3. Repetitive. I was pretty engaged in the first 30% or so. Basically until I figured out the twist. Then I was waiting for the characters to catch up with me. Then I was bored. It was lie, get drunk, blackout; rinse and repeat. Once I knew what was coming (maybe not the details, but the main idea), I felt like maybe 100 pages of the book could have been removed due to sheer repetitiveness, and it would have been fine with me. Living in an alcoholic haze with Rachel became tedious. The saving grace was the ending. At least it left me on a high note.On the positive side, I read this book for my book club, and I was in the minority on my feelings toward it. The other women either liked or loved it. So this book got a 5/6 approval rating from us. No one else in my book club figured out the twist, either, so they were far more engaged than I was. Perhaps if I hadn't figured out the twist at 30% I would have liked it more, too. Oh well.Would I recommend this book? Sure. If you like a book with mystery and odd characters, and don't mind a lot of internal dialogue, this might just be the book for you."
"This has to be one of the worst books that I have ever read.  It lacks depth, has an under developed plot and characters, is confusing, jumps all over the place, and resembles something that an under performing 7th grader would write.  How it remains on the best seller continues to amaze me.  Very poorly written, a total waste of time to read, (but trust me, it will not take much of your time to read.)  I certainly hope America's interest is such a dime store calamity is not a reflection on the education of the American public.  Take a pass on this one.I've rated it one star which is one star more than it deserves."
This book was good.  Not great. Hard to follow the dates and voices at times.  I wanted to read it before I saw the movie.
Like a UK Gone Girl. Only different.A valid example of why we shouldn't booze it up.And perhaps a bit of why we should.
"Had read a review in a magazine and was looking forward to reading it.  Very suspenseful and reminiscent of ""Gone Girl""  I have recommended it to friends."
Hated it. I couldn't read more than a few chapters. Boring
Excellent thriller. Unexpected final. One of the best books I have ever read. An amazing narrative...I felt every single moment. A must read book...!!!
"I recommend this book the story is unique, gripping and a page turner thriller. Interesting  characters. Life is about perception....the things you imagine and reality. Good read! Go for it."
"Slow moving depressing story, but interesting non the less. Glad they didn't sugar coat the ending."
"I heard the book was as good as Gone Girl,which I read and saw the movie.This book did not disappoint and I look forward to the movie."
Interesting character and development of them. Sometimes a little to much depth going back into the past.  Figured out some parts along the way. Glad I read prior to seeing the movie
I have missed to reading a book that was so intriguing that forced to keep reading. Very well written and incredibly thrilling. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Great thriller book!
"The Girl on the Train is a perfect primer for women who still believe the man they fall in love with is responsible for their happily ever after. The story is narrated by three women--Rachel, wife #1, Anna, wife # 2, and Megan, the new prospect. All are involved with one man, Tom, in an overlapping sequence of events. It so happens that Tom is perfect for all three of the women at the beginning of each relationship because he is masterful at giving each what they need. Therefore, each woman fails to see that Tom becomes manipulative and controlling. But as each relationship falters, all three women expect Tom to make it better. Unfortunately for them, Tom's idea of improving a bad relationship is to move on to a new one--which becomes a problem that hits Tom squarely when Megan, the new woman he is involved with, decides to no longer be manipulated. When she threatens to take control from him, life as each woman knew it spirals out of control.This novel is a worthy read because it shows how easy it is for some women to willingly give up control of their happiness to the man who promises them love forever. In the case of the women in this story, their unhappiness involves so much whining and drinking that it's hard to like any of them. However, Rachel does redeem herself when she starts to realize Tom has manipulated her to a level that shows he is dangerous and capable of much worse. Tom is the anatomy of a perfect psychopath, and the author leaves enough unsaid about Tom until the reader puts it all together. This book is a must for women who still believe in the fairy tale prince!"
"I read this book without reading any reviews, because there is always some (selfish) person who gives away too much of the story, or who (selfishly) shares the ending.  So I went in not knowing how the story was narrated or how the dates changed.  This is how I would recommend reading this book.I loved it!Yes, the characters can be frustrating, but I loved how each character stood on their own........until they didn't. I loved how the characters were developed little by little, especially Rachel.  I will say, it took me a few pages to decide I liked the book, but once I got into it, I had a hard time putting it down.  I found I was reading quickly because I needed to see what happened, but then I was going back and re-reading to fully take it all in.  I don't use the Highlight feature on my kindle much, but I used it a lot in this story.When it all starts to come together, when you start to see the time-line connections, when you start to feel like the ending is right around the corner.........it's not, and I loved that!  I am one of those people who watches too many crime dramas and the who-done-it is rarely a surprise, but this book kept me turning the page until all was revealed.  My only complaint about this book might be the somewhat quick wrap-up on the final two or three pages.  I wanted to know more, I wanted to know what happens to them all now.  I didn't want the book to be over."
"Initially I liked this story, but by the end I was frustrated by it.I liked that the main character had built a story around people she sees through the train window and that those stories seem real to her. I like that she comes to realize how off-base her interpretation is. I also liked that she is an unreliable narrator trying to fill in her own story gaps.I was frustrated by several things. First, the chapters alternate between different characters (a style that I am tiring of in novels), but they are also different timelines. Often the chapters were a bit longer, so I didn't always finish my reading section at the end/beginning of a chapter, and when I returned to the story I didn't necessarily remember whose chapter/timeline I was in. And because I was reading on a Kindle, I sometimes had to click-click-click through pages to find that information from the beginning of the chapter (because it wasn't always readily apparent by context).Second, there was a certain point in the novel where the clues culminated in ""whodunit,"" but the character was slow to catch on after that point which I found frustrating.Finally, the ending fell flat to me. The story as a whole seemed to be written in a particular style, but the final scenes were reminiscent of a typical murder/suspense formula.About 2/3 of the way through, I just wanted to get to the end to see how it turned out. Hence, the lower rating.Do I consider it a waste of my time? No, certainly not. Just didn't leave me thinking ""wow."""
"The book is extremely well written. The machinations inside the minds of the characters are fascinating.The deep philological twists and currents of  addiction are splayed open for the reader to view with startling honesty. This book is a deep look inside the mind of tortured soul, all wrapped up in a fairly complex mystery. Now for why I took off a star: Without spoiling the plot, I will list 3 reasons: Remember the heroine from the old films who decides she just has to go alone into the dark basement forbidden hidden room on a stormy night... with the power out... with no protection... hearing strange noises...after being threatened...barefoot...in nightgown... Now, imagine the heroine does this over and over again. Really? The book starts off with at a really slow pace and the train only picks up a little speed in the last few chapters.The angst and agony of the tortured soul becomes whining and weak when the 'victim' is caught in a cycle of self destruction. Wash, rinse, repeat. I left my review at 4 stars instead of dropping to 3 was due to the wonderful writing ability of the author, a good mystery, and the half cup of hope tossed into the rinse cycle."
"I read this, mostly, on a plane from Manila to London. I then went on a non-stop bus trip from London to Bath and found the lady in front of me also reading it.  This would seem to indicate that it is an easy read, which it is. Each chapter is devoted to a particular date over a three year period, switching between characters. I read the Kindle version and found it hard to keep track of the dates, although this is a deficiency in the Reader rather than in the Author.  I would have preferred to read the hard copy version for this reason. The story moves smoothly and the author cleverly keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome, although she drops a clue, whether intentional or not, about a quarter of the way from the end.  For this reason I found the last, inevitable, scene somewhat drawn out, but this is a minor quibble only. I have not seen the film but I imagine it makes quite good cinema and/or TV. Highly recommended."
"The girl on the train , Rachel, is depressed, her self esteem is very low , she loses contact with reality and fantasyses. She is lonely but does not look for help.She has a bad relationship with her mother and lies to her.She has never overcome the loss of her husband. She acts on her own while knowing that alcohol blurs her mind. Besides curiosity takes her to interfere into other people's affairs.She misleads the investigation .I found the novel a bit slow , it only accelerates in the last chapters.The characters are dark and full of inner conflicts.Rachel has a very low self esteem, she is depressed and drinks. She has not overcome her marriage failure .She interferes and tries to manage on her own.She is lonely ; even the relationship with her mother is distant.Megan is unhappy and wants to leave everything behind, she even tries a relationship with her psichologist and later we are told that she has had an affair with Tom.She has had a dark past.Anna is also unhappy, has left her job Gallery to look after Evie and is haunted by Rachel stocking her.Later she does no longer trust her husband and she even reads his private mail.Male characters play as second characters , only at the end Tom gives a step ahead.There are no happy characters here.I found it difficult to jump from characters in the different chapters and it tired me a bit.The end was surprising and the rythm accelerated and became attractive."
"I devoured this book in just a few days, which is rare for me these days, but a sure sign that it was good as I could not put it down. It's got a very Gone Girl-esque feel, and until the last few chapters I was totally in the dark as to how the story was going to end (and I only got an idea as to how it would because I cheated and peeked ahead a few chapters one night). Recommend if you enjoy thrillers and suspense novels!"
"Well, I'm just a regular reader, no professional reviewer or anything, but I have a lot to say about this amazing book.This ingenius novel is a fascinating look at how everybody is very different, everybody is a little similar, and those similarities and differences can twist together in amazing ways in the end.The characters are very human, being both likable and, at the same time, people we can't help but look down on.  But the characters' complexity emerges as the book gets further along, so that before you know it, you've been guilty of character assassination when you shouldn't have been.  You've been rooting for things you shouldn't have been.  You've been caught up in things in all the wrong ways.  And it happened to you right under your own nose.This book is a great ride! Twisting, turning, pulling you around.  I am an avid reader, and even I was surprised.By the time the ending is approaching, a moral has actually formed in your mind.  You don't even realize it because you've had such a good time.  But a while after you are done with the book, if you take the time to think about it, it's there.What a great book."
"I did not enjoy this book at all.  Chapters are written from the perspective of one character at a time and the timing jumps all over the place.  The story is told from over the course of 3 years but jumps back and forth during that time and is not well written.  This is not a book that is suspenseful as portrayed by the synopsis.  Things that are mentioned and you think they will play a part in the book just disappear, never to be referenced again.  I had figured out who the bad guy was very early on in the book.  And the main character, Rachel, just makes you want to grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.  If you like to read about weak women that can easily be lead by men, then by all means, read the book.  I read this because it was the choice for the monthly book club that I am a part of - I will now be deleting it from my kindle, never to be read again."
"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this but I knew it was becoming a movie and wanted to read the book first. It is an easy quick read. There are a fair amount of characters and the book is written from the point of view of multiple characters, but it is easily identified who is speaking and it is written chronologically so it is still easy to understand. Some twists, enough to keep you interested and not wanting to put it down. Reminded me of Gone Girl a little bit with the story and the style of writing. I liked it better than Gone Girl for sure, but gone girl was a bit more surprising to me. Overall a good book, nothing that I would list in my top 10 favorites, but I also wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it either. I would recommend reading it before seeing the movie because the book is better (as always) but the movie wasn't bad either. Actually, the acting in the movie was pretty good, the plot in the movie was just different than the book."
"I did not like the book at all...not enough to give it even one star.  Apparently one must give a book one star to be able to offer an opinion.  Something within me compels me to finish any book I begin, just to see when, or if, the story will ever get better.  This one never got better, at least not to me.  Imagine taking a handful of broken characters from an assortment of soap operas and jumbling them together.  This might be the result.  I must look at the publishing house.  I will use extra caution before buying from them again.  I did find this book on a suggested reading list, so someone liked it, but certainly not this reader.  I'm sorry I have nothing good to say...usually there is something good. Afraid I could find nothing good this time.  Sorry...money poorly spent.  My loss."
"I bought several books to get through the summer with. For some reason I kept putting this one at the end of the pile.  When I finally took it out,  I thought it was kind of confusing and depressing at that. All I can say is, hang on and keep reading through about the first 60 pages or so or until you just HAVE to know more about what drives these characters!  There is a lot of internal dialogue that goes on that I would think would be completely missed in the film format. You will get to know what makes these characters tick, which in itself is extremely interesting and entertaining. After you get through the first tough beginning and begin to know who's who in the zoo, prepare not to get any sleep until the story ends. This is where it takes off like a locomotive and twists and turns around every bend. Truly a thriller that makes you hold on and gasp for air! By all means, order directly from Amazon NOW!"
"I must say that the book kept my attention through all the complicated manipulative story line . Though from the beginning I hated Rachel for the boring drunk she was, Megan for the unreliable self occupied deeply disturbed woman she was and Anna for the stupid and immoral person she was. Not to think about the psychopath (ATTENTION, SPOILER!) . That the only interest in life these women had was the love of a man is so sad, are really women like that or is it , as I think, a very cliched and insulting idea of  woman? That the author thinks that these women might be considered ""real"" is very disappointing."
"My first thought after reading this book was “yup, it lived up to the hype”. This is a fantastic debut novel- one that I won’t soon forget. Does it live up to the Gone Girl status? Yes, in a way it does. The story has the same type of unreliable narrator who is suffering from her own problems and us readers don’t know whether to believe her or not. Can we readers guess who is behind Megan’s disappearance? Nope. I wanted to think I knew who did it, but when I really found out I was as shocked as everyone else. This book is awesome, albeit, a bit dark and depressing. I had so many feelings while reading this that my head started to spin! Honestly, if you haven’t picked this one up yet than I implore you to do so. It’s just a very, very, good book! No wonder it got a goodreads award!Anyway, the book is about a woman named Rachel who rides the same commuter train every day. At first I wanted to believe it was because she had to work like everyone else, but I was lead to believe wrong. You see, Rachel is hiding from her demons. She lost her job because she is an alcoholic and is trying to hide this news from her flat mate. It’s crazy how well Rachel is hiding her wrong-doings and I can’t help as a reader feeling a bit bad for her. So what Rachel does on this train (each, and every day) is watch the houses go by. But not only this, she fantasizes about the people who live there. You see, she is already familiar with this neighborhood as she used to live there- with her husband- until he left her for another woman. And stranger things continue to happen- her ex-husband now lives in the same house he shared with her, with the woman he left her for. Pretty twisted if you ask me! Either way, Rachel’s fantasizing, her mixed up emotions for her ex-husband and his new wife, and now a murder mystery begins to plague Rachel’s life. She starts with one bad decision- and her life begins to spin even more out of control than it was previously. Yikes! The happenings in this book are quite unbelievable and twisted.Overall, I loved everything about this book. It’s dark, twisted, depressing, and unique. The author has quite the imagination and she certainly brings it to life in this book. Again, if you haven’t read it than you should! It’s awesome. I can’t wait to see what the author thinks up next!"
"""The Girl on the Train” is a debut psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins who was a journalist for fifteen years before she turned her hand to fiction.  The setting of the novel is in London during the summer told through three female voices: Rachel, Megan and Anna.The protagonist, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic who witnesses a murder while on a commuter train.  However, because of her inability to remember things, her constant blackouts and incapability to separate fact from fiction; makes others not believe that she saw a murder.  Even though she has problems with staying sober and focused, Rachel is persistent in trying to find out what happened and why.I feel this is a good debut book for those that like psychological thrillers.  Ms. Hawkins has a good writing style even though I felt the action did not really take off until about the last 75 pages of the book. My deltas are I hated every character in the book because they seemed to not have any redeeming values and worked hard to hurt everyone they knew.  Furthermore, the story dragged in the middle and the ending seemed a little too pat.Overall, it had a good story line and I felt it may change how we look at the lives of others we encounter daily. I look forward to reading Ms. Hawkins next thriller."
"From page one this book grabbed my attention and held on until the very end. It has been awhile since I read a book this fast. I loved the way it was presented from the points of view of the three female characters. Nothing is quite as it appears. What we perceive from a distance can be very different from the reality. I was drawn into the complex lives of each of these women and ultimately how they were all connected. The fact that the story is somewhat dark and moody only made it more intriguing for me. I loved the writing, the depth of the female characters, especially Rachel, and how easily I could ""see"" each scene in my mind. Having heard mixed reviews about this book, I didn't rush to read it, but scenes from the newly released movie made me curious and I heard that some liked the movie better than the book. Needless to say now that I read and loved the book, I definitely want to see the movie. One of the best well-written books I have read in quite awhile."
"I read this book in almost a matter of hours. I became interested when I saw that this book would be made into a movie, and when I heard from friends how great and thrilling it was. I love reading, but I am a very visual person and if the words don't make me feel like I am actually there, experiencing everything like I was actually there, I have a harder time getting through. I was on the edge of my seat, and my heart ached for the main character... couldn't he see what he was doing to her? Why didn't he understand? Why was she having to suffer through this almost completely alone? Who did it?The little hints that Paula Hawkins drops to foreshadow the twisted events at the end are so subtle yet set the mood in a terrifyingly gut-wrenching way that makes you wish you could jump into the book screaming. The imagery was incredible and the descriptions strung together like poetry. I could smell the alcohol on her breath, I could feel the train moving, I could feel her despair. The character development is so deep, that you can't help but love and hate each and every character.It has a ""Gone Girl"" feel with its own unique flair and psychological twist, with an ending you won't see coming."
"I read _Girl on a Train_ since I knew that the film of the same name was based on the Hawkins' novel. The author's style of writing and structure, with main characters offering differing perspectives of the same events, was v similar to the genre of postmodern ""woman in distress"" novels represented best by _Gone Girl_.  As in _Gone Girl_, Hawkins presents us w a femme fatale (or two perhaps) who may or may not have precipitated their own disappearance or dissolution--or salvation. _Girl on a Train_ is a masterful psychological thriller. The novel develops well developed  characters whose outlines come into focus through, among other things, razor sharp dialogue and merciless introspection. What I also found particularly enjoyable about the novel was Hawkins' slow emergence of a short London suburban street and endlessly looping train as a character in its own right, both a geographical and psychological site of cultural and personal imprisonment."
"I downloaded a sample of this book quite awhile ago, but never managed to engage. So many people insisted it was the best book they had read this year, so I finally just hunkered down and dug in. The story is captivating enough, so I imagine that that was a big part of what the fuss is all about. And a female alcoholic protagonist is a new twist on the old unreliable narrator. My problem was that I didn't care for the characters. Not that I disliked them, they just left me cold. Plus, it was pretty easy for me to see where the story was headed, about half way through the book. I read on, hoping for a more interesting plot twist, but when the reveal came, it was unrealistic the way that the perpetrator just came right out and blurted all the details of the murder. So, why 4 stars? Because I'm impressed by all the hoopla have and every time an author attracts the kind of readership that encourages others to pick up a book, I put my own subjective opinion aside, to a degree. Right or wrong, keep reading and reviewing!"
"This site hardly needs another review of ""The Girl on the Train"", but I wanted to say that I felt that the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"", while understandable, were not really as germane as they first appear.  Yes, both books use the unreliable narrator technique, and bad things happen to bad people.  But I felt ""The Girl on the Train"" to be the superior novel.  Not only was the character development better, the book didn't strain the bounds of reader credulity as did ""Gone Girl.""  The sexual crudeness of ""Gone Girl"", the unnecessary profanity that was actually pretty disgusting, was also absent in ""The Girl on the Train.""  I simply felt Paula Hawkins to be the better writer.  I disagree with those that say that Rachel is an unsympathetic character.  People actually do have debilitating problems with alcohol, and blackouts do happen.  I couldn't put the book down, and I didn't hurl it across the room in disgust at the ending as I did ""Gone Girl.""  That's a real recommendation."
A real page turner.  You root for her and then you aren't sure you should. I recommend this on for sure.
"The overall story line was interesting and I liked that it was told from multiple perspectives, however, it was a bit too predictable to me to really be a psychological thriller."
"Don't let the beginning of this story stop you from keeping reading.  It starts out slow, but good heavens, does it get GOOD!  You'll be shocked!"
"It's unusual to meet a cast of characters that all elicit some degree of sympathy but even the ""monster"" does here but they do and their stories keep your attention riveted to their tracks."
It was entertaining but I started sighing half way through and could hardly wait for them to just get on with things. Will not recommend it to anyone.
Edge of your seat suspense  and great plot twists!! Would definite recommend to anyone looking for an easy read that isn't boring
read this over a  year ago...not sure if first person or not.  But a good read.
Interesting but one of those books where you want to choke the main character.
"I was recommended this book by a friend, not the usual genre I read. I should have read it sooner. Amazing book, it will stick with me for some time."
"Very interesting story of the young couple life. Quite complicated , psychologically explore dark side of human spirit. Very believable , almost realistic."
I could not put this book down it was such an amazing novel. I would definitely recommend this to people who love a good mystery.
"I loved how the story was told through 3 characters eyes. It was suspenseful,and at times had you rooting for and against the characters."
It was difficult to get hooked into this book and understand what was going on but stick with it. Once you do you are hooked and can't put it down. What a surprise ending!
"I've recommended this book to everyone. The story is well crafted, the characters interesting and the plot is full of twists and turns. The character development is amazingly subtle, yet powerful. A great read."
If I could give it 0 stars I would. This books is so slow and boring. It was a waste of my time and money. Would not recommend this book to anyone.
Very quick read couldn't put the book down. Just when I thought I figured it out the story added another twist. I recommend it and suggest it would be a great read on a rainy weekend.
This was an excellent book. It keeps you guessing and engaged. It was a great story line and love the way the author takes you from past to presences to fill in the gaps and set the plot. I really enjoy it.
"May have been slow to start but sucked me right in after a few chapter's.  The characters were so well defined, the plot so dark and twisted, I'm sorry I finished it. Now what?"
"Very good novel. Good detail, keeps you guessing. I enjoyed it very much"
ok
"I enjoyed the book, it's a mystery wrapped in a mystery that keeps the reader engaged enough at least to finish the book. There are a lot of implausible actions taken by almost all of the (somewhat unbelievable) main characters that really stretch the reader's ability to willingly suspend disbelief. It's almost distracting. But overall, I'm not mad that I spent the time reading this book. It's not amazing though, I'm a little surprised that it made multiple best-seller lists. And surprised that they made a movie out of it (which is not even as good as the book... don't bother seeing after reading the book, the movie actually does a WORSE job of telling the story). Do I HIGHLY recommend the book? No, I lukewarmly recommend the book. Read it if it's handy. I'd send you my copy but I already mailed it to a friend so they don't have to buy one."
"I really don't get all the hype on this book. The writing is amateur at best. The story and the characters are underdeveloped, all they feel is sad and sorry for themselves. Each woman was more annoying than the next.It started out ok, intriguing and mysterious, but 20% into it I was over it and needed the story to end. I hate slow books.It was too depressing to continue. I was 60% into the story when i decided I didn't want to continue reading it anymore. So I found out about the ending from a reviewer. Only reason I gave this two stars is because the beginning really captivated me and I desperately wanted to enjoy the book."
"I can't imagine comparing this book to Gone Girl! They have nothing in common whatsoever, other than the fact that both are written in a way that you don't like the main characters. But this is part of the interest in Gone Girl - you want to keep reading to see what happens to these awful people. Here, I hated the characters, but I wanted to finish quickly and move on to another book.I found the plot unbelievable. Why would the police not arrest this drunk woman for interfering with their investigation? Perhaps things are different in Britain, but I don't think US cops would allow her to keep wandering (or should I say staggering) into their investigation. The ""evidence"" she has to offer is so very flimsy, the fact that the author tries to force it into this investigation becomes annoying long before the book ends.If you haven't read Gone Girl, read it! If you have read Gone Girl, pick something else from whatever genre you enjoy. It will probably be better than this one!!"
"It took me about 6-8 months before I wanted to read this book.  I asked several people I saw reading the book what they thought and a lot of people said it was just OK.  When I started this book I almost put it right back down.  I did not like the authors writing style.  It was choppy.  After about 2 chapters I was hooked.  Although the style is choppy throughout, this book held my interest totally.  I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed all the characters, and I could feel emotion with each one.  I felt she developed the characters beautifully.  Normally I don't like this jumping back and forth between characters but in this case it was totally necessary to get a total view of what each character was feeling.  I thought the ending was not as great as the rest of the book but it was by no means a deal breaker.  I would highly recommend this book."
"It appears that I am in the minority, giving this novel 3 stars. Readers either love it or hate it. Which is fine, and is the  purpose of having reviews published. When you find reviewers who seem to like the same books you do, you're more inclined to consider other books they liked- that's all. No better, no worse, just different.So, on to the three star rating: This was a light summer read. I personally did not care for the author's style of writing nor how she presented the plot. There was too much focus, I thought, on how much and in what ways, Rachel got drunk, for example.  I got it. She's a raging alcoholic. No need to elaborate on each of the many incidents. And some of the events seemed just too unbelievable. As if someone could sneak into your home, drunk, take your baby while you sleep next to her, then run outside with her and not wind up in jail on attempted kidnapping charges!In addition, I wasn't crazy about the author's style of writing. If you haven't read the novel: each chapter is presented from the point of view of one of the 3 female characters, written in the first person. I began to notice that each started to sound like the others; same way of speaking, even the same expressions, at times. I found it difficult to differentiate among them, since they sounded the same. And since they are all deeply flawed, they needed more character development in order for the reader to find something redeemable about any of them. The reader needs something to hang on to- empathy, sympathy, relate ability- in order to care about a character. I didn't find this to be the case.Perhaps some of my disappointment here lies in the fact that I had just finished All The Light We Cannot See. Beautifully written and developed. Talk about caring for the characters... wow.I am not sorry that I read the book. It is a quick, somewhat entertaining read. Not something you have to dedicate part of your life to. And I can see why it has its share of devoted fans. Even if I am not among them."
"(2.5 stars) Highly overrated, less sophisticated version of Gone Girl:It was an easy read and I was intrigued by the premise of the plot, but this book is highly overrated. Most of the characters are so unlikeable and disingenuous, it's almost laughable. I truly didn't care what happened to any of the characters. The story lacked suspense and I feel like the answer to the mystery was obvious 2/3 of the way through. Overall, it reminded me of a less sophisticated Gone Girl. (I had mixed feelings about Gone Girl, but I appreciated the story's dark psychology and attention to detail)."
"I purchased this book because of the raving reviews. Many said this was the next Gone Girl. However, I found this novel very difficult to read for several reasons. First, there are many perspectives and many time lines happening during the book that I wasn't paying true attention to until about a quarter of the way through. For ex. One perspective takes place Fri in Aug while in a few pages the next perspective takes place Fri in June. The second reason I found this novel difficult to get through is the main character. She is a drunk that I had a hard time empathetizing with. Character development was extremely slow. Half these chapters didn't even need to exist. I felt as if she was just nonstop whining about her life, being drunk, and hating her life. Not a pleasurable read in the least bit.I tried several times putting the book down and starting it back up again in a few days but I just couldn't finish it. I like to read for enjoyment. If I wanted to read about a drunk who couldn't keep a job I would just go on Facebook."
"I did enjoy this book -- it's a quick read and the plot does hold one's attention. It's also refreshing to have a narrator (there are several, but Rachel seems to be the primary one) who is not especially likable; it's a change of pace from the norm.But there were a lot of things about ""The Girl on the Train"" that nagged at me. Yes, it's a thriller, but it went deeper and deeper into implausibility as it proceeded, and I felt like the whole thing could have been wrapped up 50 pages sooner. Rachel's decline, while realistic, also strains credulity a bit -- I will not spoil things, but I felt the supporting characters would not have let her go so far.I would give the book four stars but for one key failing: Every woman in this book is defined entirely by her relationship with men. Being in relationships, being mothers, being loved and ""cared for"" -- that's all that seems to matter to them. (And the men are boorish, smug cads.) One might not seek complexity in a book like this, but I was surprised by the misogyny."
"I generally try to use reviews to choose what I wish to read in part. After reading a few reviews, I kind of knew what I was getting into. I did not expect the tone of the book to be what it was though. It was dark, somewhat twisted- no, I mean a lot twisted. The characters all had personal demons. Wading through the trough of the harsh lives, cheating and treachery of the characters, I tried to see a thread of where Ms. Hawkins was taking the story. Brushing the fumes of alcohol aside and the blackout laden plot, I started to have my own theories build. The theories waxed and waned. I solved the mystery 4 or 5 times before enough detail became evident to reason it out. It was a good effort on Hawkin's part. I don't know if I would put it in the same class as "" Rear Window"" though. It is just another type of story- I think that's why I gave it the 4 stars. The lack of the final star is a common complaint I have of these types of novels. They introduce all at once a part of the plot you could not see at all- nor imagine. It is not a bunch of chess pieces scrambled on a board that slowly rearrange themselves to reveal a final end. Instead these types of stories create critical clues out of the blue that fill in vital pieces of a picture never possible before the clues are revealed. I'd rather have all the pieces laid out there and when the fog lifts, you find yourself saying"" I should have seen it! Great job"". Nevertheless,  it was still a good story, filled with the sick helpless feelings being lost and depressed if things in a ""perfect world"" we're to suddenly go bad. You might want to go outside after finishing this book and look out at a clear sunny day and praise the good fortune of being healthy, happy  and trusting enough to believe all people have good in them. With this book Ms. Hawkin's cuts through this ""good"" as fantasy and paints a different picture of what we are or can be. Somehow, the will to survive and rising above it all- hoping we are still decent at our core may endure. But, you will have to read it to see if that is true."
"I enjoyed this book and was even a tiny bit paranoid for a couple of days after. When I finished I thought I should have been disappointed, but I wasn't. ""Should've been"" because the main characters were not really very likable, bits of imagery from the story seemed implausible, and the writing style - three women telling the story all in the first person can be confusing especially if you put it down midway through one of them. ""Wasn't"" disappointed because an alcoholic trying to piece together information from her blackouts to solve a mystery was intriguing from the start, even if it's been done before, and I was fascinated to be allowed into the mind of this character I didn't much care for in the same way reading about a different place can transport you out of your normal everyday experiences, even when it's not just where you want to be. I imagine Hitchcock would have liked the ending as he used a similar theme in one of his stories ... I won't say which."
"Almost everyone I know has read this book. I wish they had warned me that the first half of the book was five or six characters in search of a plot-line. The girl on the train was an emotional trainwreck, whinging on and on about her past while she drank herself into blackouts. The other characters that were presented were similarly self-absorbed. At about the halfway point there was some development of a storyline and it quickly became obvious who the bad guy had to be. The final quarter of the book quickly laid out the storyline, solved the riddle and revealed the culprit -- no surprise.If you liked ""Gone Girl"" this is similar, but not comparable. The characters are so nebulous and self-absorbed that it was impossible to care what happened to them. The plot wandered a lot which could have been interesting, but somehow it was not. I gave it two stars because it was well-written."
"I agree with others who found the characters all so interchangeable and vile, their dialogue one lie after the other. The author's use of 3 first person monologues ever mixing was so annoying, though I get why she did it. It got so I couldn't tell who was doing the talking half the time, that's what I mean by ""interchangeable."" They were all awful, awful people. I got so frustrated with this that I rushed to finish it so I could be ""rid"" of it for good. Not one redeeming factor in any of these characters, all utterly without morals or apparently, will power... they deserved the misery this book was. I will skip Ms. Hawkins' next work and I don't intend to go see the film just released of this. My curiosity has been fed. But I had to see for myself if this was worthy of all the hoopla being made over it. Not in my world. Another ""Gone Girl""? Not even close."
"Not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.They just made a movie out of it and made comparisons to Gone Girl which I had read.  It is not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.  Gone Girl was more suspenseful and moved along much faster.  This book was confusing and depressing more than dark.  The main character is a drunk.  It was a matter of figuring out who killed Megan.  I will leave that to those of you who want to read this.  There really are not that many convincing twists in this book and the outcome is really not a huge surprise in my view.  The Author tries to obfuscate it but really fails as it is too contrived.  I found the first 2/3 of the book pretty slow going.  Only in the last 1/3 did things really pick up some, but then it was just letting the pieces fall into place and frankly I was not surprised in the least.  Good luck with this one.  I consider it pretty much a waste of time reading this one."
The Girl On The Train is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I read a lot and love suspense thrillers. I loved how fast paced this book was. I didn't get bored. I can usually guess the ending of movies and books pretty quickly but this one took me for a spin! It was exhilarating! I typically don't like when authors go back and forth between characters. If I can't read it in one setting going back and forth gets confusing. Because of how faced paced and exciting this book is I didn't have that problem. I was able to stay interested from the first page until the last. I was able to keep up with each character and loved how each one developed as you go through it. I felt like I was right there with Rachel through all her flashbacks. Definitely a best seller! Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out. I will be adding Paula to my list of favorite authors too!
"Since all the characters were unlikeable, didn't care who did it and wish they had all been killed.The IDEA of things observed/story lines created from train window was intriguing, getting this one at least 1 star.But...I hated every minute of reading it."
"What a fantastic page turner, murder mystery, psychological drama with three really troubled women each telling their story.  Rachel, an out of bounds alcoholic with an out of bounds imagination and jealousy; not a very likable person, for sure, but I did keep rooting for her.  Megan, hollow and shallow and haunted by her past and Anna, the young, naive, trusting, suspicious wife and mother......Add three flawed men and you get a marvelously written gripping, entertaining delight. Wish I had been on a long plane flight and not trying to distract myself from the election.  Did not come away with any profound insights about life......just loved, loved the marvelous, entertaining distractions; the details of modern day transportation (trains) in England.  Yes, it is a bit depressing and dark; but it's a murder mystery...Isn't that what reading is all about?"
". . .  restraint writing this book.  For the reader this book is like a present with 336 layers of wrapping paper that are slowly removed to get to the gift within.  I am not saying this is a lovely story.  It is not.  It is ugly and scary, but it is written so beautifully that I enjoyed every word.  I was so enthralled with the writing that it took me awhile to realize that it is narrated by several people.  It was a smack myself in my doofuss head moment, but it didn't bother me at all to start the book again paying attention to who was speaking.Even if you do figure out who the bad person is early it doesn't matter because it's the story and how it unfolds that is important.  This book is full of pathetic, flawed people, but I felt hope at the end.I am not sure  I will see the movie.  I like suspenseful books, but I don't like scary movies even when I know what happens."
"It takes a while for the reader to get passed the fact that none of the narrators in Paula Hawkins, ""The Girl on the Train"" are likeable reliable narrators.  All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.  Hawkins does a superb job of keeping the suspense up without revealing much of her hand until the very end of her tale.A young wife goes missing; one of the first person narrators, Rachel, knows the missing girl--she's observed her in passing from the window of her commuter train.  She wants to help the police; she wants to help herself.  She needs a new starting point in life because her husband has left her for another woman . . . and now they have an infant daughter.Hawkins writes of disturbed people whose faces are raw with shame and self-pity.  Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.Bottom line?  Some might find the characters too disagreeable to give them time to work their simple magic.  Make the time; this thriller is quietly exciting and chilling in its every day reality. Recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""Buzzard's Eye View"""
"The 3 stars are for the 1st 1/3 of the book.  After that, you still hang in there, but the claim that ""you won't see it coming!"" is bunk.  The author is really talented, but she goes down a very predictable path, and to me, both drops a bomb and advertises it's imminent arrival.  I wish she hadn't gone for the birthday party surprise (when you could clearly see your friends' cars parked in your neighborhood) and just taken it to another conclusion less like ""the butler did it gotcha!"" kind of thing."
Was excited to read this book but now that I have I'm not sure what all the hype was about.  I hope they tweaked the movie to make it better.  The jumping back and forth between time and characters was somewhat confusing at times because the first person narrative of the three different characters all sounded the same so sometimes one wondered who exactly was talking because they all sounded very similar.  I'm disappointed I spent the money for the Kindle version.  I don''t even know I would have been okay with spending $3-4 at the used bookstore either.
"In a word: crap.I took this book with me on a beach vacation because I wanted something to breeze through, something to entertain me. I do not ask for much in my beach reads: plot, some coherent writing, character development. I gave this book more than a fair shot. But I'm stopping at page 175.Poor writing, flat characters, and the author's sexist tone seeps off every page. Every female psychosis is on display here: dressing the part, feeling worthless, feeling like a child, sexual motivation behind how men act, women's revenge, ""I'm a force to be reckoned with,"" ""all these men,"" the list goes on....I can't take it anymore. Life is too short to read bad books like this one.I hate it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
"The three principal characters in THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN have much in common. They're not very likable, they're depressing, and they don't have much taste in men.Rachel is the girl on the train. She's lost her job for drinking on the job. Her husband has left her for another woman, and to top matters off, he's had a baby with his new wife, with whom he was carrying on an affair while still married to Rachel. That's what broke up Rachel's marriage; she couldn't have a baby. She takes the train to work every day to fool her land lady roommate (the nicest woman in the book) into thinking she still has a job. The part about the train has to do with two people she sees almost every day on their veranda. She doesn't know them, but she convinces herself they're the happy couple. She even gives them names. They live a few doors down from where she used to live with her husband Tom.The second woman is Megan. Megan lives with a horrible secret I won't reveal here. Let's say, psychologically, it has affected her. She's the woman in the ideal couple, but she's far from ideal. She sleeps around; she even makes a move on her therapist. It's not clear whether he sleeps with her, but Rachel does see them kissing from the train.  Megan also winds up dead. That's the best part of the book as far as suspense is concerned. I read a lot of mysteries, and usually I can tell who did it within the first fifty pages, but there are several candidates here, and I didn't know who killed Megan until the author told me.The third woman might be the creepiest of all. She had an affair with Tom and she knew he was married. She even reveled in it. The woman is close to a sociopath. She only cares about her own little world, her husband and her baby. When she is confronted with a physical threat she runs away. Some might argue that she's only protecting her baby, but it seems to be more than that. She also does something creepy during the denouement to someone who can't defend himself/herself.I really don't see how this book has stayed on the best seller list for most of the year. As I said above, about the only redeeming quality is the “who done it” aspect. It's also hard to believe that Megan, who worked at an art gallery before it closed, would babysit for people she barely knew, that is unless you consider that the author needed her to. Her horrible secret also involves a baby. This is called author intrusion, and it's a bad “no no” for literary critics."
"The Girl on The Train by Paula Hawkins… OMG! This has to be one of my absolute favorite reads in 2015! Murder, obsession, evil, jealousy, cruelty and heartbreaking at times, The Girl on The Train has what it takes to keep you turning those pages and let me tell you… the twist at the end will have your jaw drop! It is so deceptively simple in some ways, that as you are reading, suddenly the sun is setting, day turns into night and your eyes have not left the page. I wasn't furiously turning the pages, I was absentmindedly turning the pages because I was so engrossed in the story.Here's the gist… Rachel Watson rides the train everyday past a housing complex and becomes obsessed with this couple she sees most days lounging on their patio… until Rachel sees something that she shouldn't see. But because Rachel has some problems of her own, when she tries to tell someone what she saw, no one believes her… until… Read this book! Both a great murder mystery and literary fiction. Well written characters, a leading lady that you can empathize with, and a great story. If Hitchcock were to write murder mysteries, this would be it!I give this 5+ Train Tickets! Hop aboard and enjoy"
"A friend suggested this book to me,knowing that Emily Blunt would be playing Rachel in the movie. I started it a couple times, but couldn't get into it. The switching back and forth between characters was really confusing to me and I couldn't tell what was what. Then after my husband read it, he explained that once you get to a certain point it makes more sense and at least the characters are made clear. It did become more suspenseful and then I just needed to know who did it. My thoughts wavered a few times between the characters, but in the end it was not my first pick. It all made sense then and I'm glad it turned out the way it did. I'm glad Rachel and Anna helped each other in the end. Still a pretty creepy story though. Reminds me of all the sick stories you hear about in the news. Unfortunately, there really are people out there doing these terrible things. Scary!"
"The Girl on the Train occupies a similar space as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. In both, we move through the minds of multiple narrators who may or may not be lying, to us and/or to themselves. This ends up being very effective and is what pulls you forward into the story, despite the fact that the inciting incident doesn't rear its head for thirty or forty pages.While there are three characters we focus on throughout the book, the first is arguably the main character: Rachel. She has been divorced for two years and is a serious alcoholic. She blames her drinking for her current state and for the end of her marriage. She's living with a friend, paying rent, and lost her job several months ago. Too ashamed to admit it to anyone, she continues to take the train into the city every day.The train stops regularly in the same place, behind some houses in a nice little town. From her vantage point on the train, Rachel watches a married couple go about their morning. She calls them Jess and Jason, though she doesn't have any idea what their real names are. She's constructed a perfect little life for them in her head.But it falls apart the morning Rachel sees Jess kissing another man on her back porch. And shortly after that, Jess goes missing entirely.I won't say more for fear of spoiling what is genuinely a good story. Just know that we get multiple perspectives on the events, and everyone is much more connected than may first be apparent. Highly recommended if you're into Gone Girl and that sort of dark, psychological thriller. A well-constructed mystery with compelling characters."
"In a nutshell: it was ok.Let me start by briefly explaining why I chose this book. Everyone seemed to be raving about it. Even NYPL! So, as usual.. I thought: I need thisin my life! I had (unfortunately) high expectations about this book and I didn't even bother to read what was it about. I read that it was similarto Gone Girl, I even quote: ""“The Girl on the Train has more fun with unreliable narration than any chiller since Gone Girl. . . . [It] is liable to draw a large, bedazzled readership.”—The New York Times"".In my opinion, it is just an ok book. I still have my doubts if it is a cleverly plotted thriller. Paula Hawkings indeed tried to present compelling characters,but to me, they were a bit too predictable and in some cases, annoying. Now, it alternates between three points of view (all females), and to me, tends to fall to unnecessary (not always, but in this case) and gimmicky. Basically the whole mystery is a mess right up until the last chapters, where you get a grip of the situation. The ending for me was extremely melodramatic, and I thought for a minute I just read a Hollywood movie. Very few real twists, first chapters are monotonous. Plain and simple: just mediocre.While on Gone Girl we saw how the author fought back against female cliches of the accommodating victim or love interest with a cold, calculating villain, The Girl on the Train takes a less defiant angle. The main character: Rachel is delivered through an unwittingly unreliable narration to evoke the aftershocks of abuse and trauma. Do I think this was a powerful way of exploring women's marginalization? Not entirely. I am not 100% convinced. I did not like any of the characters, and to be quite honest, the male roles were a bit stereotyped (that is just my impression). I do not get what is the hype about this book? It isn't a bad one, but surely not a master piece either! It is a bit depressing even?Conclusion:*It is an ok book, touching the limits with mediocre? Take this book for your summer holidays at the most. Do not expect a deep, fascinating suspense book.*Boring, a little bit depressing? At the end picks up the pace and you feel more hooked.*Complex but a bit predictable characters.*Easy to read!"
"This book, read from the perspectives of three different women on divergent and convergent timelines, leaves quite a bit to be desired. Paula's writing is difficult to follow, the characters are mostly unlikable and make very questionable decisions. Common sense is apparently lacking in this particular part of England.What started off as a novel premise eventually meanders its way into half-truths, mis(sing)-information, and lots of ""surprises"" that are less surprises and more like the guy who tells a joke but has to keep going back and adding in more detail because he forgot. This frustrating novel is really just a  long joke, with lots of ""oh yeahs"" and ""I forgot"" (literally).If all of the characters involved got hit by the titular train I think this book would be more compelling. Alas, that's not the case and we're left with the sour aftertaste of characters ripped from a Maury Povich show."
"I’m no expert when it comes to this genre or analyzing a writer’s intent. I took the book as a personal look at myself. One who live a good portions of my life in the same state as Rachel , but with a different storyline..it was all darkness. Never looking back at the ones criticizing , I fail into their opinion of me. It took and still does take years to look back and dissect them. Rachel at the end started to see the people around as they were.. as I have. The book as read it , was all in darkness, as my former life was. As I formed a kinship with Rachel , I found empathy for her – you ( I )may have an understanding of what was , but the darkness remains. Other reviews –reviewers can, I’m sure give , a more distant view of this book, but I can’t. A couple weeks have past since I read the book, but when I pick up my reader I still feel its impact of it on me. But the book was like an AA meeting, as you hear others , you get a better understanding of yourself and the past. Please read other reviews by others, who can see this book outside of the forest , I have not gotten far enough out to see it."
A few people highly recommended this book so I gave it a try. Found the beginning to be very slow and almost stopped reading it. The story eventually got interesting but I never really cared for the main character. Maybe the story will be turned into an interesting movie but I cannot recommend reading the book.
"Disappointing after all the hype. The plot was twisted and unpredictable, which was good, but I stopped caring about what happened because the characters were so uninteresting. The story was told from the point of view of three female characters: Rachel, the primary character, was whiny and weak, still pining for a broken marriage with a nasty two-timer; Anna, the woman he cheated with, didn't come to life at all; and Megan, a neighbor of Anna's, seemed to be calmly narrating her fate even while expiring. In any case, I failed to connect with any of them. And the male characters, without giving the ending away, were disturbing and violent. It takes more than these one-dimensional people to make a mystery novel interesting. This one failed to deliver."
Loved the book copy and I would love to see the movie to this wonderful book that keyed me on the edge of my seat.
I'm about halfway through the book and I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN!! I just know something disastrous or crazy is about to happen.
I enjoyed this book. The short prose of each character kept it flowing smoothly and kept me intrigued. Good read.
Five stars.  I never knew what was going to happen and it was always a surprise.  A very good book.
"I found the writing elegant but the back and forth between the stories of Rachel, Anna and Megan was unnecessarily complex and often repetitive."
The book could have been better paced. But it is undeniably a very good thriller. I think it could have been shorter and the suspense would have still been the same.
"Told from the point of view of three women, the mystery surrounding the disappearance of one of the women is revealed.  The first person narrative allows the author to obscure the details based on personal perspective and keeps the reader on their toes until the very end."
Really great book. You really don't know who did the crime until the characters do. A must read for anyone who loves figuring out puzzles.
"Considering the characters' POV and personal issues, I consider this a tragic story rather than a suspenseful mystery."
Just finished re reading this great book before I see the movie.  Hope that they stay true to most of the book!
Made me want to see the movie.
Very exciting read.  I have to admit that I got a little disgusted at times with the lead character.  Had some elements of GONE GIRL in it I thought.  Keeps you in suspense and worth reading.
"i wasn't sure about this book in the beginning, but it got better as it went along. It was worth keeping up."
excellent story. Figured out the end about 80% through but still a very exciting ending. Really worth the read. Once you're into it a real page turner. Great read for both men and women.
"I couldn't put this book down. Great thriller! You fall in love with characters that you'd typically hate, this Author actually makes you fall in love with these very flawed characters."
"GOod first novel, but left dissappointed and the read itself was overly contrived. Will be curious as to how they handle it in the movie..."
This is an interesting mystery that will keep you in suspense.  Good story Have not seen the movie.
This book kept me guessing the entire time. I definitely needed s one wine at the end. Great book and can't wait to read more of her books.
"I watched the movie first , I thought the book would be awful because I fell so in love with the movie but j was wrong I was just as wrapped into the book!"
Started with great interest....was a little redundant and ending was not as much of a  mystery as I thought it was going to be
"I enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down once I started reading it.  Paula Hawkins has a very unique style.  If you like a good mystery, I would recommend reading this book."
Now know why this has been on the Best Sellers so long. Great page-turner of a story. Lot's of twists to the plot. Loved it!
"Movie worthy Story, with solid gripping suspense."
Gripping and Intriguing. Very well written! There will def be a movie is there isn't one in the works already!
Book kept me in suspense. Great read highly recommend can't put they book downCan't wait to read second book
If I could I would give this 6 stars. Read it in one day simply because I couldn't put it down!
"The use of , His, Hers and He and She, instead of using a persons name was often confusing.I didn't particularly care for the format or the index."
What a great read this turned out to be! I'm a HUGE fan of Gone Girl and this rivals it on my top 10 list. Very interesting and fast paced.
"It was a good read, but I didn't really connect with the characters, which seemed sort of flat for me."
"Loved this book! A NY times best seller, it was entertaining and a good read."
"I didn't want the motion picture to spoil the book, so I made sure to bump this reading up on my list. Overall it was good - the plot had just enough twists to hold my interest, and I appreciated the set-up of the chapters being narrated by different characters during overlapping periods of time. It allows you to see the same scene from the eyes of different characters. That being said, I did figure out the ending without meaning to. Maybe it's all those crime shows I watch. I guess I just can't be thrilled by the thrillers the way I used to be. I also found that a couple of the character's voices were too similar for their differing personalities, but that's just me being picky. I would recommend the book if you're looking for a plot with scandal and emotional turmoil with an underlying premise of the existential crisis that can result from love gone wrong."
"I feel this book started slowly......a boring account of random details that jump back and forth. However, a little more than half way through I see the meaning of all those details as they start to merge together and tie my mind into a suspenseful clutch that kept me interested and unable to put the book down.Even after the ""big reveal"" towards the end there's still a lot of questions and suspense and the story draws to a conclusion. I do feel it ended rather weak.....missing that OMG feeling as I turned the last page. And still I have two remaining questions???(Possible SPOILER BELOW)1) What ever happened to Scott? Did he find out what really happened?2) Did Rachel and/or Anna tell the police about Tom & Megan??Did I miss something?"
"I think that what the book lacked in the beginning and middle, it made up for in the ending. I, of course, won't spoil it here, but it is very slow up until the ending which was somewhat predictable. The characters, main included, are somewhat dry, and altogether predictable. I can't help but imagine that the book would have been a much better read if told from Anna's perspective, as she was one of the only complex characters. Affairs are the key point of the book, though none take turns away from the predictable. The book spoils itself around the middle--towards the end, providing 1-2 red herrings before finally settling into the finale; naturally tidying the story and hitting all of the tropes of a murder mystery unabashedly. For myself, I read the book expecting the caliber of story that a Gillian Flynn novel may provide, a good airport page-turner to get me through a flight. Though this was a book that bored me in the beginning, middle, hooked me 30 pages before the ending, and finally disappointed me. I usually refrain from giving negative reviews, but honestly I wish someone would have let me know that there was better junk-lit out there. Try Gillian Flynn, Stephen King, or anything really. If you are tremendously bored, give this one a go. I couldn't pay attention to this book and ended up playing with my napkin if that gives you any notion of how this book is read."
"Girl named Anna – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Megan – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Rachel – she’s a bit messed up. Rachel likes to ride trains. One day she sees SOMETHING, and nothing is ever the same.To be honest, this book was a bit of a letdown. All the hype. All the intrigue. It just fell a little bit flat, and left me feeling deflated at the end. I thought there would be MORE.This story is told in alternating perspectives from three different women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan, each with their own set of unique baggage. I disliked them all so much, I can’t decide who I like the least – but this was an I-enjoy-not-liking-you dislike, if that makes sense. However, none of them really roused much empathy from me, and I only developed surface level feelings. Frankly, I just didn’t really care all that much about any them.Don’t get me wrong, it was good enough, and certainly held my interest. I read it pretty quickly, and definitely was invested in the story. The alternating perspectives, and the way it jumped around in time, though commonplace in books these days, was, for the most part, successful here. The writing was simple, and clipped along at a decent pace to grab and maintain my attention.All in all, I would say read it, but it’s a case of been-there-done-that for me. It obviously works for some people though, given it’s reigning status at the top of the bestsellers list. I also think it would make a great book club pick, as it’s short, quick, and full of plenty of chat-able fodder.For more, visit www.bookishtendencies.com"
"I had a hard time getting into this at first, but I put it aside and went back a few weeks later. I just wasn't ready at first for the first-person accounts of all of the characters, written in present tense, it was confusing. But I decided to give this author a chance, so I went back to the first few chapters to see how she'd crafted the characters and dated the scenes. If finally fell into place, and I went right through it in a couple of days. I like the way she placed the blame, or allowed the reader to place blame, on other people, and finally when the true culprit came to light, I could breathe a sigh of relief, and was glad that people aren't always as they seem, and for the most part these characters had reasons for being the way they were. It's a well-written psychological drama/thriller."
"Rachel Watson is a down-on-her-luck young woman who rides the train in and out of London every day to hide the fact that she has lost her job from her roommate, and to maintain a tenuous link to what she once was: gainfully employed, happily married and sober. One particular house near the railway tracks fosters an increasingly unhealthy obesssion in Rachel on these daily trips, with its seemingly perfect couple who sit on the terrace. Is it a secret longing for what Rachel once had? Or something more forbidding, something on her own emotional doorstep?With its Hitchcock like setup and close similarity to Gillian Flynn’s work, ‘Girl on a Train’ opens with this compelling story question. Then Rachel’s blurred recollection of a crime she witnesses in a drunken stupor causes her to stumble through the lives of others, wreaking havoc on ex-neighbors, her ex-husband, and aggravating the police, who soon lose patience with Rachel’s drinking and lies. You may actually find yourself doing the same as she keeps hitting the bottle.But ultimately ‘Girl on a Train’ disappoints. It just can’t live up to its promising start.If ever there was an unreliable narrator, it’s Rachel.And this is part of the book’s problem: The reader is too often misled into feeling one way about a character, only to have it not be so. The mystery itself relies too heavily upon Rachel’s opportune blackouts, taking us to the edge of discovery only to learn that she just can’t quite remember what happened. Until she does. And then the murderer does something so dumb (keeping a key piece of evidence any killer worth their salt would surely have gotten rid of) that it violates the ‘maximum capacity’ rule of a worthy villain. He/she also manages to give the clichéd, expository summing up toward the end of the book, explaining in detail the crimes committed and the motives for committing them.Like Gillian Flynn’s books, the parallel to ‘Girl on a Train’ is apparent: multiple narrators switching back and forth in first person as the crime unravels, everyday people living lives of quiet desperation, marriages that appear to be perfect but aren’t. But whereas Flynn’s writing can soar, and her characters are rich and nuanced, Paula Hawkins’ prose is deliberate and too ordinary to make us want to spend so much time in her character’s heads. There are clarity issues in the story telling as well, not helped by the fact that all three narrators are young English women of the same age, same class, with similar backgrounds and voices.Girl on a train is a solid suspense read however, although mystery buffs will find themselves want more."
"I gave this book four stars because I really enjoyed reading it, and sometimes couldn't put it down. I would have given it five stars but for some reason I had a VERY hard time with the fact that Rachel rode the train everyday to pretend that she didn't lose her job. That she would get ready, ride the train in the morning, find something to do for eight hours, and then ride it home, just because she didn't want her landlord to find out she'd lost her job. Doing all of this while dealing with alcoholism and depression just doesn't sound believable to me. As long as she paid her rent on time, why would it matter if she lost her job?  Each chapter would be from a different person's point of view which would sometimes get annoying and confusing, but in the end made for a very mysterious and enjoying read."
"Don't stop reading this book!  Once you get thought the first little bit (and it is not boring... just building slowly and with purpose), you won't be able to stop.  Like the trains that permeate the story, moving it along and giving it reason, the book begins slowly, like a chugging locomotive trying to pull its passengers, overcoming inertia, and then builds as the story weaves itself in and out of the lives of each character, ultimately racing along like a runaway train rushing headlong with its full inertia, dragging all the passengers (and you) to the final conclusion while making you unable and unwanting to put it down.  Once you figure out the mystery you will watch the characters as they put together the pieces and make decisions leading to their ultimate destinies... and you will be unable to turn away, watching, wishing.As you read, you meet each character through both her own eyes as well as through the eyes of others... very intriguing.  And I love the use of paralleling the characters and their lives... wonderful!  When you begin reading, you must pay attention to the dates... they are important.As a warning to those who become engrossed and completely absorbed into books and their characters I must say that during my first couple of chapters I did feel nauseous, but only because one of the main characters was ""feeling ill"" (and it was not due to content).  Again, this is only because I allow myself to really enter the lives of the characters.  But I am so happy that I did not let that deter me from continuing.  Read this book!"
"I bought this book, ""The Girl on the Train"" because I had heard that it was a great book, with lots of plot twists and turns.  I had heard that it was a similar type book to ""Gone Girl.""  It does have lots of plot twists.  It is similar in type to ""Gone Girl.""  It simply is not my kind of book.  I like mysteries -- and this book was definitely mysterious from beginning to end, but it was definitely too dark for me.  (So was ""Gone Girl, so I should have known better)  I don't want to give away the plot, but I will say this -- If you want a feel good book, this is definitely not the one for you.  I like to finish a book and feel better by the end.  I didn't see that happen here.  It was well written -- each chapter takes on the persona of one of the main characters, so you really do get to feel what they are feeling and doing.  It does bounce back and forth through time, but the chapter headings will let you know that."
"Paula Hawkins hit the ball out of the park with ""Girl on the Train.""  It is very interesting and a page turner from the very first page.  Ms Hawkins slowly expands the story from a sole character riding the same scheduled trains to and from work every day, or so the reader is led to believe.  Nothing is as it seems.  There are two more women added as primary characters and here's the thing I've never experienced before, Ms Hawkins continues the story as each of these three women, seamlessly, speaking as each of them in the first person singular.  Just pay attention to dates and times of trains.  That's all I'm going to say.There are many, many reviews that you can read here that will tell you the whole plot.  I would never begin reading a book knowing the plot and I won't do that to you here.  What I will do is comment to people who have come to trust my taste as to whether they will enjoy this book.  Is it worth the money?  Is it worth your time?  To both I will say very big YES's !!!Paula Hawkins can write and reading her is such a pleasure after reading some of the junk that has been put out to us from really major writers.  You will enjoy the way she treats the English language and you will enjoy this very unusual story as it is narrated by three different women from their own points of view.Buy it.  Have a good read."
"I have to be honest even with all the amazing reviews I still think I barely liked it.  I bought it because of the zillion good reviews and I am sure that is why most are buying it.SPOILER:I am ok at predicting plot twists but I feel like this one was very very obvious. I mean from the second they tell you Megan babysat and he smiled at her and then a few pages later ""he"" smiled at her driving by it was very obvious that it was Tom...I mean you can't help but compare it to Gone Girl and although I did not like the ending of Gone Girl , Gone Girl blows this book out of the water. Flynn's book is so smart and clever this is kind of boring and mostly about an alcoholic who you don't feel for and I could not even get myself to like a single character or be interested in any of them.I did not care for it at all to each his/her own."
"Really, more of a 2.5 star review. The initial premise of a troubled woman who becomes engrossed in the ""passing lives"" of a couple whose home she sees daily from her train commute is a good one. Unfortunately, it was the highpoint of the book for me. I'd guessed the plot by about page 60, and really kept reading to see if I was correct. (I was) I truly kept hoping I would be surprised. The story is told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Megan and Anna, with Rachel being the main character. She's a drunk. Eventually, she becomes an such erratic unlikable, needy repetitive drunk, I was just kind of hoping she'd jump from the train. The plot is facilitated by convenient blackouts, which I could buy into, but it's the clipped points of view of the other two characters that I found to be weak writing. The chapters from Megan and Anna's POV are limited because they're clearly holding back information they know--particularly Megan. A red flag example is a short Megan chapter dedicated to inner thoughts about her lover, whom she refers to as ""he."" The lack of a proper noun tells me the ""he"" she's having an affair with in this chapter is a different ""he"" than was mentioned by name in an earlier chapter. With only so many characters in the book, ""he"" became quite obvious. If you don't think too hard while reading, I can see where The Girl on the Train is an interesting book. I don't think the plot is anything close to masterful."
"The Girl on the Train is the perfect thriller to read on a trip--it's quick and easy to read, it's intriguing, and it keeps you guessing.I have to say, Hawkins has done a great job at creating a slew of characters to dislike. I don't mean that as a bad thing, though. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book where I felt like I was my own detective, trying to solve a mystery where I couldn't even trust the narrators. There was some type of a plot twist around every corner, and in the end, I was very much satisfied by the climax and conclusion Hawkins created. (I'll add a quick caveat here that there was one part of the story towards the end about one of the character's backgrounds that is so quickly explained, that it felt like an afterthought thrown in for necessity, but not development--that was disappointing).The only major complaint I had about this book was that so much of it felt unoriginal and cliche to me. The characters were somewhat dull: Rachel is an alcoholic, Megan is a restless obsessive, and Anna is a narcissist. But very little of each of these character's traits were developed further. And the men in this book were so black-and-white that I sort of pity any man who reads this book because the stereotypes are so plain to see--the men are either doting, kind-hearted lovers or oppressive, jealous villains.But then again, maybe these cliches were exactly Hawkins point--to make the setting and characters so ordinary that it made the story just that more chilling."
"It took quite an effort to get through it It really draggeedandwas depressing at least half way through it. After reading, I will skip the movie."
"This is a tough book to review, because I cannot honestly say that I disliked it. I liked it. Begrudgingly, I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip. It is not a life-changing journey, nor is it something that will leave you feeling as if you learned something, but it will certainly keep you guessing."
"I'm usually not a fan of mysteries like this because the ending seems to be obvious early on in most authors' writing. But it came highly recommended and I got it for a long airplane flight which proved to be a great idea!  It took the first person view of several of the women involved and really twisted the possibilities around. This was entertaining, suspenseful, not cookie-cutter at all, and actually had me guessing almost to the very end. I'll definitely recommend it to others and look for more books by this author."
"This book made feel goosebumps. Certain parts were written very well that it had me looking behind my shoulder. Good mystery had me guessing pretty much the whole way convincing me along the way that it could of been others. Only negative to me was that some parts felt like fillers pointless and dragging on very few though. I recommend this to any mystery reader, people struggling with alcohol (me), and I personally think those books are awfully written but any fan of fifty shades of grey would enjoy this. Watching the film later."
"I typically don't read bestsellers, because I want to give my time to relatively unknown authors who are struggling to get their books into the hands of readers. However, my book club recommended The Girl on the Train and I didn't want to comply so I read it. OMG! I haven't put it down in the last three days and it took me three days only because of work obligations. There are so many reasons why I loved this book. First, technically it is superb! Second, the transition of Rachel is exactly how it should of been stronger, but still flawed. Anna, the one person she hates and desperately doesn't want to have something in common with now shares a forever bond. The book was exceptional! Congratulations to Paula Hawkins!"
"I know that I'm one out of thousands who wrote a review for this book but I just couldn't help myself in relating my viewpoint.  I bought the book from amazon because every article raved about the book, calling it the new ""Gone Girl"", which I also read.  The story revolves around three women; the girl on the train, Rachel, who really should be the ""woman"" on the train because she is no longer a girl, being in her thirties.  Meagan and Anna are the other two women in the story.  Rachel, who is out of work and an alcoholic, gets on the train every day to go to a job that she no longer has and returns at the end of the day to where she shares a flat with another woman.  She is also an ex-wife of a man who has remained in their home, with his new wife, the one who caused the divorce, and their baby.  The new wife is Anna and Meagan is their neighbor.  These people all live in homes bordering the train tracks and so Rachel, on her travels to her non-job, passes by and watches them in their daily lives, still pining away for her ex-husband and builds an imaginary life for Meagan who lives with her husband a few doors down.  As each woman speaks in the novel, you get an insight into what really is going on in her life.  The problem with the story is that Rachel, Anna, and Meagan all appear to have the same personality which confused me and I found myself going back several pages to see which woman was talking.  Since they each had different problems and lives it would make sense that they had varied personalities and would not sound like Rachel.  And even though Rachel didn't want her flat-mate to find out that she lost her job, I couldn't relate to the fact that she was spending every day traveling into London and back again, just to spy on her ex-husband, etc.  Many times I wanted to put the book down and forget it but once I pay for something, I force myself to read on, hoping it will improve, thus the ending, which I found a little more to my liking.  I can't say that this is the ""new"" ""Gone Girl"", because the story is different and I couldn't really get hold of the characters as well as I should.  It's the kind of novel that you take to the beach if you're near one, or read in the backyard for an afternoon.  For a first published novel, I think the author tried to put the story into perspective as she saw it, but I felt I had to push myself to finish the book.  Happily I did so that I could enjoy the ending."
"I was so excited for this book, and I am so genuinely disappointed. There was nothing original or ""thriller"" about it plot-wise, the main character is highly unlikeable (there are no redeeming or even EXCITING or INTERESTING qualities about ANY of the characters, but the main one is just an unlikeable, bland, boring person), and the whole book is really very boring until the last 15 or so pages, and the action that fills those pages is VERY predictable. There's no plot twist, there's no hero or heroine, there's little to no character arc/development. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping for that spark or twist or something that people kept raving about. I would give it 1 star, but I feel that it does have potential to be a good movie if done correctly; I'll be seeing it."
Got this book to read before seeing the movie. Loved it!
"Two abusive men, three unstable women.. what's to like about it..  much hype some really unlikeable people.."
Lots of people like this book. I found the characters unlikable.  The story became tedious.
Both the book and the movie held my interest which is saying something with modern literature.
Read the book before seeing the movie.  The book was a page turner.
Keeps you guessing. A little bit slow in some parts though.  Would recommend to a friend. Great Book overall though.
One of the best books I've read in 2016. I could not stop reading.
Alcohol says it best!!
"This was a great read, finished in a couple days as it really kept my attention. It felt a bit obvious but it was still enjoyable."
I recommend everyone read this book.The twist at the end was difficult to see coming.  This is an exceptional novel.
"The Girl on the Train asks questions that our society shies away from. How important is it for a woman to be a mother? If someone cheats, who is to blame? Should an alcoholic be trusted and how much is too much?Rachel tries unsuccessfully to put her life together after her marriage crumbles. She rides the train to and from London everyday, caught up in her thoughts and swimming in the aftereffects of a night of drinking. The train always stops at a row of houses, where Rachel sees Jason and Jess living out their romantic lives. Rachel witnesses an argument between Jason and Jess and the next morning Jess is reported missing. Rachel is thrown into the mystery surrounding Jess’ disappearance while clashing with the lives of her ex-husband Tom and his wife Anna.A cast of suspicious characters make an appearance as Rachel works to discover the murderer. Though the killer’s identity is well hidden, the story reads less as a “who done it” and more like a sympathetic narrative of a suffering woman tossed around by circumstances. I identified with the struggle of the three different narrators, their ugliness ringing as true as their virtues. This is a great summer read and will keep you up as you rush to discover the ending. It is definitely worth missing sleep at night!"
"If you haven't read much up on this book yet, I highly suggest not reading about any of the characters or even a plot summary before reading the book. I think it might take away from some of the elements of the writing that I personally might not have enjoyed otherwise if I had done so. (That said, I mention the main character in the next sentence but it's vague enough to not give anything away.) The main quality I found endearing about this book is the main character, Rachel. She's a hot mess in a dark place and I've definitely had times in my life that felt somewhat similar to that, so it was interesting to see how she handled some very less than comfortable situations. One of the main twists I actually kind of expected so I think that made the book seem a little bit less suspenseful to me, which made this would have been 4 star a 3 star for me."
"It was just okay! Maybe because the book was hyped up so much, I expected a lot more. Instead I found it to be a bit shallow in terms of the plot and character development. It wasn't clear why the police kept on jumping from one suspect to another without really having reasonable leads or evidence... and why certain characters were introduced and portrayed the way they were (other than to mislead the reader). It was a quick read though... and worth reading if one is planning to watch the movie."
"Will keep this short and sweet - good book, chapters are broken up by character which I found very interesting and unlike most of the books I read. A good portion of the book dives deep into each of the main characters, namely Rachel. In general the book kept my attention and was easy to follow. I do remember the moment I couldn't put the book down - around 80-81% (read on my Kindle). <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A> I don't usually have reactions to books like that and/or find time to read consistently (have 2 kiddos under 3).Have not seen the movie, probably wait until it's avail at home. Have heard from many that it strays from the book (not a big surprise), but what seems so silly is that the book is based in London and suburbs, why is the movie in NY? I love NYC, but come'on!"
"I became interested in this book after seeing a preview of a teaser of the movie featuring Emily Blunt which is coming out this year. After doing some research, the summary sounded intriguing and I decided ""Why Not!?"". So glad I did.I couldn't put this book down and read it within two days of its delivery! Even covering my reading light with the comforter so I didn't disturb my parter. He appreciated that, haha.The story is told from different viewpoints, keeping you guessing as to who did what until the end. I've heard it's similar to Gone Girl, which yes, I have yet to read or see the movie...gasp, I know! But, if you like the mystery, who did it book type of storyline, then I recommend checking out this book. Now, just waiting to see how Emily pulls off the lead character."
"A rare treasure, written with verve and suspense, impossible to put down, and yet it needs perspective, standing back from it, contemplating the nuances, the self-absorption, the narcisistic nature of alcoholism.  Narcisists don't have to be beautiful, they don't necessarily revel in their self-esteem.  Quite the contrary, underneath it all they fear they are not beautiful and their self-esteem is absent or damaged, but they are absorbed in their own reflection, content, in fact surreptitiously delighted to subject those around them to their compulsions.  Yet Hawkins has turned it all into a mystery thriller.  Her recourse for the character's catharsis is chilling.  Are all women masochists?  And do they love the sociopath in compelling men?  This book is exceptional, far more than just a ""good read"", despite the occasional and very minor slips in syntax."
"I enjoyed the first three quarters of this book. It was exciting and fast-paced, and I enjoyed being pulled into the main protagonist’s mess of a mind. While she was a wreck and an alcoholic, I still found her sympathetic enough to be likable. One of the themes of the book was that no person or family is perfect, and I think the author did a good job of conveying this. I also enjoyed the buildup as we discover what’s going on with the other woman, Megan, in this story.My disappointment came toward the end. Maybe I’ve read too much fiction, but I didn’t find the twist all that exciting or interesting. Because of this, I did enjoy “Gone Girl” and the awesome use of the unreliable narrator a lot more. Given all the positive reviews, it seemed like “Girl on the Train” was going to lead up to something really unique. Given the deteriorating mental state of the protagonist, I was preparing myself for something along the lines of multiple personality disorder or finding out a character wasn’t real. (Not that those devices are completely unique—but I was still waiting for something kind of off the wall) Instead, it just becomes a terrifying domestic dispute. The men in this story are also very unlikable and needed a few more redeeming qualities.I’d recommend it for a fun summer poolside read but don’t expect too much."
"The story starts of from the viewpoint of a woman so depressed and in such psychic pain that she regularly drinks herself into oblivion. She lost her husband, her job , rents a small bedroom from a friend, and  pretends  to take the train to work each day and sees  the back of houses on her old street as she goes into London.  She daydreams about a  couple a few doors down from where she used to live  and she occasionally  sees one or both of them and others as the train passes.  She imagines their life together as perfect and as what she had so longed for.  She is so devastated about being left for another woman who had her ex-husband's baby and she feels so sad that she lost him and agrees with him that she was to blame.  The sad part is, she had  been systematically taken apart, her pride, her will , her sense of self , by  a sociopath who enjoys seducing, controlling, and then draining women of any sense of worth and when he succeeds, abandons them as they are unworthy.  Some tiny little glimmer in her peeks out  and she ends up intervening in the life of the husband of the young couple  when  the wife disappears and the husband  is a suspect (and she has seen another man with the wife).  Very difficult to read and harder to put down and, while true to itself, nothing is as it seems.  Psychological thrillers are not my favorite, this was recommended by a friend, and was compelling."
"""Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”Rachel Watson rides the train to and from London every weekday. The train stops at the same faulty signal, near where Rachel use to live with her then-husband, Tom. While waiting at the signal, she looks into her favorite track-side house, hoping to see the man and woman who live there. Although Rachel doesn't know them, she calls them Jess and Jason. Rachel has woven a fantasy about them, and they have the perfect life. Except they don’t.Desperately unhappy, Rachel has developed a drinking problem. She is unable to accept that Tom has remarried and lives with his new wife and their baby in the house he shared with Rachel. Rachel has made a nuisance of herself to the point of harassment--calling Tom repeatedly and stopping by to see him, especially after she’s been drinking.What Rachel sees from the train one day will compel her to insert herself into Jess and Jason’s lives and put her own in danger.This story was quick-paced and hard to put down. Although I cringed at some of the things Rachel did, her character was so well-developed, I could sympathize with her. The Girl on the Train is an excellent debut novel, and I can’t wait for more from this author. I highly recommend this book for readers who like a taut, well-written psychological thriller."
"This is not a good book. The ""twist"" was obvious early on and not much of a surprise. What is with these female novelists who write these absolutely pitiful female characters who are so dependent on a man and popping out babies to give them social status that they are utterly broken and inoperable without these things. BOO!"
"This book started off slow for me.  And I thought a little confusing.  I kept getting bored and putting the book down.  I also didn't like the main character.  Then about midway the whole tenor of the story changed.  But I still couldn't get in to it.  Then, bam, near the end the story picked up speed and turned very intense.  And I still didn't care what happened to the characters!I like a good mystery but this one was convoluted with unsympathetic characters.  I was sorry I wasted my time."
"3.5 stars actually. I was a fan of Gone Girl and this book is structured similarly. The first half was really suspenseful but, just like with Gone Girl, I figured out about half way through who the real villain was. That takes some of the suspense and enjoyment out of the reading. Another issue I had  is that the entire narrative depends on the main character's frequent and complete alcoholic blackouts. Now granted I don't know much about alcoholic blackouts but they seemed a bit too convenient in terms of the narrative. In fact, without them, the entire plot wouldn't exist. So, in summary, if you liked Gone Girl you'll probably like this one just don't expect to be too surprised when the killer is revealed."
"I read the reviews prior to buying, and I assumed I wouldn't be able to put it down, as many other reviewers stated. Actually, the opposite happened. I just wasn't too interested nor involved in this book. It took me a while to finish, which is a disappointment for me. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, and it just didn't for me. Sure, the story offers some twists and turns, but it was just too slow. My life is not changed after reading it, as I like for it to be after reading a great book. Other reviewers say it is similar to ""Gone Girl,"" and was recommended to me after I read ""The Kind Worth Killing,"" both books in which I gave 5 star ratings to. This book is a shame compared to those. It just did not keep me intrigued."
"This story moves, propelling the reader onward.  The author is a good and descriptive writer and gives an immediate impression of the gist of each of the characters she follows.  If you are looking for a suspense read that will pull you in and make you want to finish the book in a weekend, this does the trick.Rachel, the ""Girl on the Train,"" who imagines the lives of a couple whose house she passes every day, is a drunk.  Daily, her train also passes the house she used to call home, now inhabited by her ex-husband and the woman he left Rachel for.  Twice daily on her commute, Rachel alternately mourns for the life she lost (and curses the women who supplanted her) and imagines the perfect couple down the street from her old home whom she views from her commuter's window but doesn't know.  Maybe due to her reliance on being drunk to cope with a life that has severely disappointed her, Rachel often is hesitant to act when contemplating a decision.  This does make some of the chapters repetitious at times, but the author's strong sense of place and use of description largely mitigates this criticism.Comparison's to Rear Window are obvious.  As with the Hitchcock masterpiece, Rachel gets involved when she witnesses an incident from her train that is out of sync with the imagined life of the couple she views every day - the couple about whom she has constructed a vivid, if alcohol fueled, perfect life.  There are a lot of plot twists, though this is the kind of book where most of them are revealed by the three protagonists and not pieced together from a well laid foundation of clues.A good book, quick read and pretty good freshman effort from this author."
"A fast moving story involving several people. Those being Rachel (The Girl on the train) Tom her ex husband Annie his current wife, Megan the woman who goes missing and Scott,  Megan's husband. Of course also members of the Constabulary . When Rachel was married to Tom she was not able to bear children and eventually she became more fond of the bottle than anything else. This quite often led her to have trouble recognising what was real and what was a dream. The story is narrated by the 3 women and explains to you what was going on with their lives. So long as you don't mind a bit of foul language the story is quite gripping and even though it is of fiction what happens probably happens a lot more than we realise.Well worth a read."
"Well, thanks to Joe Hill my interest in reading has reached a high I haven't reached since 5th grade, when I read classic, Elementary books such as ""Holes"", ""Where the Red Fern Grows"", and some other titles I can't pull out of my ass right now.Joe Hill's books created a reading monster, and before I even finished ""NOS4A2"" I order Paula Hawkin's, ""The Girl on the Train"", a first person narrative about an alcoholic, divorced lady, Rachel, who's black-out antics may or may not have lead her to kill a blonde whom most likely reminds her of Anna, the woman who Rachel's husband left her for. In contrast to the tremendous, fantasy, 3rd person writing of Joe Hill, ""The Girl on The Train"", is rather straight foreword.This doesn't make ""The Girl on the Train"" bad, I love the book! Read it, it's a really quick read and it puts its reader in the shoes of multiple characters with a clever-ease that isn't confusing like I've found some other novels to be. But...if you're picking this book up after reading possibly one of the best books of your life, prepare to plateau in dissapointment.In vulgar terms, it's like if you dated a guy with a ten incher and you both break up, then get with a guy who's like 7 and a half inches. See the new guy is big, but he's not a porn star, and that makes your downstairs mixup, quite sad."
"The book departs from a good premise. Rachel, a conflicted woman (not a girl by any chance) spying on her former husbands new wife and some neighbors which houses rest in the path of the train that she takes every morning to work. Or to pretend she works. She's a full blown alcoholic drifting on a world of fantasy.Cleverly, Hawkins jumps from her point of view, narrated as a diary of sorts, to the view the three women in the novel. The observed neighbor, Megan, who has a complicated life and demeanor far from Rachel imagination. And Anna, her former husband's new wife.The conflicting POV work fine for a while, until half the book. There it stumbles a bit with contrived twists. Perhaps the weaker point of the novel (spoilers aside) is that in many ways pretends to be a whodunit, with a very small pool of suspects. The best point is the characterization of the women (all of them, even Rachel's roommate, poor old good-sport Claire; exception noted for non convincing detective Riley), and the misogynous dark world they inhabit, where beyond roleplaying as companions, mothers, wives, lovers, sinners or victims, there's not much left for them to aspire.Good first fiction effort by Hawkins."
"This story got my attention from the first page and I truly enjoyed the whole ride. When writing this review, I was trying to find something that I didn't like about it,to be fair, but couldn’t find anything and this is what my 5 star rating shows.The plot basically revolves around Rachel, who takes the same commuter train every day and suddenly sees something rather than usual, that changes her life for ever. This particularly event and a few mental-life crisis moments will make Rachel figure out that what is in front of you, sometimes is not always what it seems to be.It is told through the voice of three different women, which gives the narrative a more clear insight and adds mystery to the story.I have read Gone Girl before and I can say is one of my favorite thrillers of all time.I thought I was hardly ever gonna have the opportunity to read something similar to it, but let me tell you, I did and it was thanks to Paula Hawkins.There were sometimes that I couldn't believe what I was reading, it has an original  storyline that keeps your hearth pounding, gripping and wanting for more. I totally recommend it.Favorite Quotes:- “Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.”-“I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”- “It's  possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.”-“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”-“I’ve been the fool. If he does it with you, he’ll do it to you.”"
"This is a page turner. I was completely engaged in the story and always in suspense. I loved how the writing alternated between characters and how you really get in their head and yet see what they think of the others! The alcoholism was accurately portrayed. So glad I did not watch the movie first as I wanted to create my own visuals and see if the director was able to bring it. Good movie but disappointing in regard to being true to the story and bringing the suspense. For one the setting takes place in the USA in the movie. Wtf? I wanted it to be in England! Too many things missing from the movie as well, but thats the way it is. Books are ALWAYS better! Great read. I recommended it to my friends and they were NOT disappointed!"
"As appears on Goodreads.com I finished this on St. Paddy's Day and I'm still torn between 3 and 4 Stars. Author, Paula Hawkins had me spell bound. Her writing is fierce - she certainly knows how to spend a very suspenseful tale, keeping the reader quickly turning the pages despite ALL of her very unlikeable characters.Rachel is Tom Watson's ex-wife. She is quite pathetic. She's a drunk and unemployed. But each morning she rides the train to London (to save face) pretending she's just another commuter. And the train always stops very near her old house where she was happy and hopeful with Tom. A few doors down live a beautiful couple that she's dubbed ""Jess and Jason."" She imagines their life together, giving them wonderful attributes and marriage. Looks can be deceiving as the real ""Jess"" - Meagan - shows us. Tom's current wife hates Rachel and truly believes that Tom's ex-wife is unstable and dangerous to her, Tom, and their baby daughter. Everything is going as smoothly as each woman's situation can go until one of them suddenly disappears. Rachel must interject herself in the investigation. After all, she's invested a year of mornings and evenings watching this woman. Bad decision, girlfriend.The story line is told from each of the three women's altering POV, and that technique is powerful and makes the novel work. As I've said there is not one redeemable or likeable character in the whole book, but the reader is also a Rachel - a voyeur of a sort like in ""Rear Window."" Something bad has happened and we know it's coming and we can't shut our eyes. We readers must know what happened and by whose hands."
Wow...this book had many twists and turns...really enjoyed it..there were times when I could not put the book down..Great Read
"I only wish she diddnt end up alone... And that the girls would have stayed friends, and that the guy would have suffered more."
"Ugh....it took everything in me to even get to page 50, at which time I skimmed quickly to the end and wasn't impressed at all.  If you like Gone Girl then you'll like this.  I liked neither."
"So well written, such a twist! I usually figure out rather quickly who did it but this one kept me guessing! A must read!"
"It was an interesting way to read a book, from several points of view. I kept wondering how it was all going to pull together."
Better than the movie
"I can't decide if I really liked this book or not. I kept reading just to find out the who and why, but found it hard to like any of the people."
Confusing at times in the beginning and then frustrating at other times. Keeps you off balance and eventually you can't put it down.
Great read!
"It was alright. TBH I don't understand all the hype about it, but it was a pleasant enough read. I wanted to scream at the heroine throughout pretty much the whole book. I think my biggest problem with the book was that I didn't actually like any of the characters in it, not even a supporting character. I found it hard to connect with the story because of that."
It kept me reading wanting to know what would happen next! A good mystery with a little twist.
Great read
I could not stop reading this book! The characters felt so real. It is a must read! Highly recommended! :)
It think I was expecting a lot more going into it. It wasn't terrible but it was a little too dramatic for my taste.
LOVED it!
I'm not usually into mystery/thrillers but this was very entertaining! It is a little slow to start but it makes up for it later. Just read it.
Loved loved loved this book.
great book
Quick read. Suspenseful till the end. I enjoyed it up until the very end. Surprise ending that I never saw coming.
The Girl On the Train was a really good read. Kept me guessing until the end. The author really captures the voice of the main characters. Great job.
Boring!
"I liked the story, but wasn't thrilled."
This book builds on events slowly but keeps the reader engaged all the way to the end. I would recommend this to all my reading friends!
"The book's opening chapters grabbed and held my interest. Then my interest began waning and quickly was transformed to annoyance, impatience, outright irritation and finally, full-blown dislike. I ended up really disliking this book. I thought the plot was so implausible and contrived - and, of course, many suspense/mystery novels are implausible and contrived, but this is yet another one of the type that has no foot in reality - as to be unacceptable. It veered into absurdity. More than that, however, was my increasingly intense dislike for all of the characters - every single one of them, but probably most of all, the main character, Rachel. I found her alcoholism, her black-outs, her laxity, her passivity, her strange behavior even outside of her alcoholic binges, everything about her just repugnant. But that was true of every character for different reasons and to varying degrees of dislike. The stylistic technique of alternating ""voices"" was OK and the different female characters represented in those voices were fairly well distinguished, enough so as to follow ""their chapters.""  One thing that I did appreciate, and it stands on contrast to ""Gone Girl"", was the absence of detailed, specific, ""graphic"" sexual material. There were indirect references but we weren't forced into the beds, bodies and minds of people in sexual encounters - and I appreciated that!  I didn't find any obvious type or similar types of editing errors, also appreciated. I thought the basic style and quality of writing was OK, outside of plot. Character development was OK, but they were just so thoroughly unlikeable and unlikely, in my opinion.2016 has been a year that for me, as an enthusiastic reader, has been a year in which I have learned to distrust blurbs, critics, and reviews in general.  I have read too many books this year that were glowingly reviewed, best-selling, even award nominees - and yet left me thinking:  where have all the great novels gone? Do I have to return to beloved books of the past and re-read?Apparently plenty of people like this book a lot. I'm not one of them."
Very suspenseful. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and engulf you the entire time. One of my new favorites.
I got a chance to read over a 3day Christmas break.I didn't put it down.A must read before they make the movie
Fantastic book! A page turner for sure!
It was a fun read. I enjoyed the main character and could identify with her struggles and pain. She was very real
It's a hard one to ever put day
Good Read
"Didn't like the characters, and found the plot very predictable."
"It took me 50 pages before I understand what was going on and that there were actually three different people's point of view. Once that happened the book was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the end. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five was because there were too many spelling errors. Being an English major, this drives me crazy. If you need someone to proofread your book, let me know. I'm free"
"Starts as a chick flick, then shows out as down and dirty drama.so different from other normal style of explaining real life.just buy it."
Good book.
The story line was too slow until the end when the story was reaching it's conclusion.  I lost sympathy with the main character as her behavior got boring and unrealistic.
As good as Gone Girl. I could not stop reading and finished in one day.
"when you need something new to read, this book might be interesting"
Would have been a five if they didn't talk like sailors.
Suspense that never let's up and keeps you turning the pages.
"A page turner! I couldn't put this book down! Sitting at the edge of my seat! I'm sad it's over, I hope a second book will come out!!!"
"I very much enjoyed this book. It was nearing the end before I figured everything out, and although there were some reveals I had not seen coming, nothing was out of sync with the portrayal of the characters. It was all one of those ""oh, that makes sense now"". With the back-and-forth chapters between characters and time, I would have done better with a hard copy of the book as opposed to the Kindle version as I couldn't remember the dates/times well enough without needing to look back (which is too much of a pain on Kindle for me to mess with). However, once each chapter started, it was pretty easy to keep up with whether the timeline was past or present so it wasn't a problem and made the story more intriguing than if were told straightforward. There were moments of suspense, but for me it was more thoughtful as I tried to work through what each character had been through, what they were feeling, the struggle with their past and their present, and how it affected their actions along the way as the book built up to ""what really happened"". I will read this one again."
"This book is appropriately titled because it's like watching a train wreck - you simply can't look away. Mesmerized from the beginning, I could not put the book down until I was finished. I HAD to know the end.One review I read called it ""Hitchcockian"" and I could not agree more. It reminded me of the movie Rear Window. Told from three different women's points of view, The Girl On The Train is a suspense thriller at it's finest.I am a character driven reader and writer and the characters in this book are written brilliantly. Rachel is a literal train wreck herself but the author wrote her in such a way that I felt sorry enough for her to want to know her story. And I really wanted things to work out for her. The other characters were so full of mystery and intrigue I felt unease about each one, never truly knowing them or what they would do next.And I loved how the book ended. The author didn't leave the reader with frustrating unknowns but wraps it up in a way where I was satisfied but can't stop thinking about the story. Brilliant. Excellent read."
"I'm flabbergasted by the rave reviews, especially that there are 17,500+ mostly positive reviews. At the 20% mark, I debated ending the boredom since nothing had happened yet. Once I got to about 50%, I was still bored and confused about what all the fuss what about because still nothing much had happened. But I slogged through and finished, and I'm still shaking my head. Not one of the seven main characters is likable. Most of them drink heavily. The pacing is slow and repetitive. The book felt so amateurish that I really question what has happened to the reading public that books like this and Gone Girl, another poorly written and over-hyped mess, are so popular. Are books with fully developed characters and carefully crafted plots too challenging for people? I just don't get it."
"What a waste of time.  This book is getting lots of attention while it should be ignored.  I should have put it down when 4D (Drunk, Depressed, Ditzy, Destructive) protagonist continues haranguing the ex-husband.  This one is hard to stomach, 4D has no clue as to her ex's character?  She goes to work for months after being fired? 4D can't remember what she did while drinking but later in the book does.  The only cheat the author didn't succumb to is magic."
"Rachel rides the train every day past her old neighborhood and feels regret for the life she used to have.  She sees the new neighbors and imagines the life they're living.  Somehow she gets involved when the woman she's been watching goes missing, but Rachel is a raging drunk and her memory is sketchy at best.This felt like it took forever to read, none of the characters were likeable,.  However, I did learn that gin and tonic is available in a can, so there you go."
"Meh.  I wasn't very impressed.  While the story line was okay, I felt that it was predictable.  I think all the hype set me up for disappointment.  I felt that a lot of things were repeated, and grew tired of reading the same types of details used to describe the characters.  I thought it was interesting when the author went into detail about alcohol induced blackouts, but once again, mentioned it so many times, which played a part in the predictability.  The way the story wrapped up was especially jarring and disappointing.  it was unrealistic, and again, contributed to it's predictability.  its a short and somewhat enjoyable read, and many people enjoy it.  If you're looking for a book to jolt your senses, push buttons, or affect your emotions in any way, this book is not for you."
"This novel was a page turner for me.  I hated putting it down.  However, none of the characters is likeable and they are all rather depressing.  That doesn't bother me, as I like novels that have interesting character development.  I did think most of the characters and many of the events were unrealistic and over the top, but that is true of many novels. Think of science fiction and fantasy novels, for example.Rachel, the main character was an alcoholic and I kept hoping she would straighten up and quit drinking.  Much of the time I just wanted to shake her for making repeated poor decisions.  Her ex-husband Tom had left her for Anna.  They had a baby, something Rachel had not been able to do.  Anna and Tom seemed to be happy, but then he was cheating with Megan whom he hired to be a babysitter.  The story is told in alternating chapters by these three women.As I said, the novel kept me reading and wanting to know what would happen next.  I kept trying to figure out who was a reliable narrator and who committed the murder.  It was well written too. I guessed who the murderer was after reading about 80% of the book, but I occasionally thought I might be wrong.Even though I liked it a lot, it is not a book that I'm likely to remember a few years from now, perhaps because several of the situations seemed contrived."
"A got drawn into this book as much for the story about the dark journey of an alcoholic hitting bottom as for the tale of whodunnit.  I felt the author was quite good at detailing with accuracy and nuance the bizarre, guilt ridden, unreasonable inner world of a woman lost in blackout drinking.  The main character is pathetic, but she is sympathetic enough that I found her ultimately heroic.The author adeptly crafted a whodunnit tale with enough twists and turns, weaving a web of storylines with just enough believability that kept me guessing long enough.The authors strength was her keen understanding of the human mind at it's darker limits, reminding me a bit of what I loved so much about Crime and Punishment."
"I couldn't wait for this book to be over. I purchased it because it was on the 'recommended' list if you had enjoyed A. Doerr's exquisite novel  All the Light We Cannot See...which is on my top 10 forever list. It is unfathomable to determine the logic used to couple it with Doerr's masterpiece, but I assume this is why Hawkin's book has sold so well.There was not one character with whom to develop a  hopeful compassion (key ingredient) and draw you in intimately. I hung in and kept reading The Girl on the Train thinking Hawkins would somehow pull it off but alas...the depressing story  laid itself flat all the way to it's merciful conclusion.  Save your money. Pick up Lady in Gold and All the Light we Cannot see and sink into something you wish had no last page."
"Rachel is fat.  Fat fat Rachel.  Rachel drinks.  Drinks, Rachel, drink.  Rachel is unlikable.  Poor, poor Rachel.  Add in ex-husband Tom, who is shown to have about as much personality as paste.  New wife Anna, who slept with Tom while he was married to Rachel, and seems to exist primarily to whine about Fat Rachel (and Anna can't seem to think of Rachel without saying that she's Fat).  Scott, who sleeps with Rachel even though she's Fat and his wife has been murdered, and Megan, the murdered wife who has a history, but again no personality.  And finally, Rachel's roommate who exists solely to complain about Rachel's drinking.Dull.  Tedious.  You don't care about any of the characters.  And you can't really guess who dunnit as there are so few clues.Ah, well, if cured my insomnia for a while."
"It took me a bit to get invested in this book, but once I did I was hooked. The premise is basically a woman, who is an alcoholic rides a train every day and passes a house where a couple live, and makes up names and a happy, perfect life for them, and then one day something happens. That's about as much as I got from the blurb, and as I didn't read any other reviews, it took me awhile to figure out how this could even be interesting. However, there is much more to this story. The author fills in the plot holes slowly, and through different perspectives, but it all comes together. There's a twist at the end I began suspecting, but then when it came it was still gratifyingly good. The main character, Rachel, is pretty frustrating, but it's nice that she gets her, for lack of a better word-balls about her there at the end. They're making a movie of this with Emily Blunt and I'm very excited to see that adaptation as well. Great read."
I have NO IDEA why this is #1 on the best seller list. It is OK not great. Read this book if you are on vacation or taking a flight and want a book that won't make you think. It's an easy read. None of the characters make you want to care about them or solve the case.
"Read from November 29 to December 01, 2015 I can't really write a review because I think I'm lost somewhere in the book. Paula Hawkins has a vivid imagination and a talent for sharing it with us in the form of a book. There needs to be 'other' characters besides the 'main' characters, and there are. But I found myself getting ahead of the writer with my own assumptions and a couple of characters are left scratching their heads and squinting their eyes wondering when there turn will come or that's how I see them.I wanted to be surprised in the end and I wasn't. I was even a little disappointed, but that could be my own vivid imagination getting in the way. I may even go back and read the last few chapters to see what I may have missed.4 stars for The Girl on the Train. I really did like it. I liked the concept of the part the train played in it all, a very good character by the way. I do recommend the book. Maybe someone can fill in some of the gaps for me. (less)"
"I found the character of Rachel to be quite enjoyable, just because she's so difficult to like. In fact, all the characters in this book are difficult to like. They're all flawed. They all do awful things and are general a-holes. Still, you can't help but look at them and wonder if you see pieces of yourself in them. Have you ever cheated on someone? Been cheated on? Lied? Been a little too violent in an argument with a SO? Drunk-dialed/texted an ex, over and over, or just embarrassed yourself by being able to let go? Made a fool of yourself? Came to work hung over and useless? It's a good read, for sure. I'm sure reviewers like to use words like ""unflinching"" to describe it.I personally just enjoy books with characters that beat back the stereotypes. Rachel totally did that. She's overweight and totally makes a fool of herself repeatedly. You're disgusted by her weakness, and yet if you've ever been in a relationship, especially one that ended poorly, you can probably feel a glimmer of understanding.Hollywood will undoubtedly make this into an unrecognizable mess. But oh well, such is life."
"""Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She's even started to feel like she knows them. ""Jess and Jason,"" she calls them. Their life - as she sees it - is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves on, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?""I found ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins hard to put down; it's definitely a page turner with many quirks. I've read that Hawkins is being compared to Gillian Flynn which is difficult as this is Hawkins' debut novel, but I'm hoping Hawkins continues in this genre.I enjoyed the way that Hawkins draws you in, the way that you think you know what is happening; but as the story unfolds you start to question Rachel and her judgement. I did realise whodunnit, but this didn't detract from the novel (as I was near the end) but it was the circumstances and the characters who were the true ""twist"".Four and a half stars - I look forward to Hawkins next novel."
"This book is told from three different perspectives: Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train to and from London every day, watching the houses and imagining the peoples’ lives. Megan is one of those people, and she spends every day fighting within her own head about what to do — does she still likes her husband, or should she run away? Anna is the new wife of Tom, Rachel’s ex-husband. They live in Rachel’s old house with their baby girl, Evie. Rachel, depressed with how her life has turned out, spends her days drinking, usually ending with making a rude, drunken call to Tom.One day, Rachel sees Megan’s face in the news — she’s gone missing. Rachel has to battle her blackouts — she knows she saw something important, but she can’t remember. She knows she has to help.This book, widely regarded as the next “Gone Girl,” is a psychological thriller. It’s a strange feeling, as a reader, when the main character is such an unlikeable woman who is unwilling to help herself. However, with more and more information, more revelations, you begin to see why she is how she is. She has to fight for herself, for people to believe her, to have purpose in the world. “The Girl on the Train” is a solid thriller and I will definitely be reading any future books from Paula Hawkins."
"I didn't really sense any ""suspense"" in this novel until I reached the half way point. I was annoyed with keeping track of chapters with dates, and there are three different female voices which makes this a difficult type of book to read on a Kindle. I almost quit half way through the book because I just didn't like anyone in the story. However, I'm glad I finished it because the author did eventually bring the story to a satisfying conclusion. I have read reviews that compare it to Gone Girl and it doesn't rise to that level at all. I think I would have edited out half the alcoholic stupors for Rachel because I just got tired of her reasons and excuses for being how she was. The book is simply Okay."
"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It was a page turning psychological thriller that was hard to put down and can easily finished in a day or afternoon of reading.  The main character, Rachel, is somewhat of a sad case that has not gotten over her failed marriage to Tom, who has moved on with another woman, Anna and recently had a child (something she was unable to give him).  As if the divorce and her inability to have children is not enough, Rachel is constantly reminded of Tom’s new life without her every day as she passes by their home that was once hers on the train each day.  She is obsessed with them and their neighbor Megan and her husband.  The story is told from the perspective of the three women; Rachel, Anna and Megan.  As Rachel’s life continues to disintegrate throughout the novel, her obsession with the couples along with her drinking problem continues to get worse.  As her life falls apart, she becomes engrossed with Megan’s disappearance and trying to solve what happened to her.  With the three perspective stories the reader is left trying to figure out what eventually happens to Megan upon her disappearance and how all three women are connected.  The climax and ending of the book is truly shocking and will leave you wanting more from Paula Hawkins.  The plot would make an excellent movie and I am looking forward to more work from this author."
"Great read!! I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it.I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it.One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation.The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women).  As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving.While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although  the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end.I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it. It would make a great book club read."
"I have not been intrigued by a new novel, in quite some time, as I have a habit of sticking to my favourite authors.  When I read the premise for 'The Girl on the Train', I was so curious and excited, I immediately bought a copy of the novel.In short, I liked the book....but I did not love it.  I enjoyed the diary format, the 3 person point of view, and I even thought that it was very interesting and refreshing that the author made each of the characters quite unsavoury and almost un-likeable.  What caused me to rate this story less than a perfect 5 stars is that, although it was very readable, it seemed that certain scenes were repetitious, especially noticeable with Rachel.  And... Although the ending was good, it just seemed anticlimactic.I am also quite curious about what this author does next and how ""The Girl on the Train"" translates to film."
Gripping and compelling the whole time. Unpredictable twists and drama throughout the book. I can't wait to see the movie.
"definitely not for me, not for man"
What an amazing story!  I literally did not take a break from beginning to end.  So many plot twists and turns!  Awesome!
A riveting mystery. Don't try to watch tv while reading this or you will be confused.
"Entertaining and quick read. However, if you are a law and order junkie like myself, a bit predictable.  Good beach read."
"Wow,  I couldn't put it down.  Rachel's voice  is so real my heart ached for her.  A page turner to the very end."
Great suspense!
My first read by this author. Good writing and she definitely pulls you in. The book keeps twisting right to the end.
This book just grabs you! Could not put down. Had me thinking about it for days after I finished the book.
A great novel with many twists. It will keep your attention right to the great ending. It was hard to put down.
"This book  had me enthralled from the start , the ""heroine"" of the book evoked feelings of sympathy as she stumbled through her life , a victim of a cruel  heartbreak  which leaves her as a pitiful victim , though it is easy to understand her despair and feel for her as she weaves her fantasy to distract and escape from the hopelessness and unfairness  of her situation .  This is a compelling thriller and I really couldn't put it down. Was the conclusion as twisted and clever as I would have hoped? I can't say it left me with a big ""wow"" factor as I would have liked but still a satisfying conclusion. I like the way the 3 female characters were involved in the storytelling and like all good books I became emotionaly involved in some way with each character .  Defiantly a good read I recommend it."
"...then read this book. Otherwise, skip it. I promise. One day, I will find the person who took the bribe cash to get this $16 cinder block onto the NY Times Bestseller List, and I will not allow them to get away from me until they are able to recite the definitions for ""Hitchcockian"" and ""psychological thriller"" from memory.The writing is stilted, the timeline is funky, the flat characters are pancake flat, and the main and round characters are written just well enough to keep you from beating your face in with whatever vehicle is carrying this work to your unfortunate retinas. If anything, this book made me wonder what type of activities the author had time to engage in while writing it, because she clearly wasn't working on any kind of character or plot development."
"I finished this book a few days ago after several people at work started reading it and saying how good it was, so I of course had to read it. But whoa was I not prepared for my mind being blown and all over the place with the writing style. I enjoy a book that gives point of view from different people don't get me wrong,but when there is so much switching back and forth and with dates involved it becomes too much. And once I finished I sat there for a good 5 minutes still in shock, because of who did it and my unanswered questions. Overall I would say I liked it, but it won't be a book I would read again, it took me well over half the book just to get into it like everyone else did. But it's worth a read, and four stars."
"The Girl on the Train had my attention at times, other times I felt like I was just trying to get to the end. The main character, Rachel, is a divorced, jobless, alcoholic. She shows up at her old house (which is now being lived in by her ex, his new wife and their daughter) and doesn't remember it the next day as she suffers from alcoholic amnesia. She makes up a pretend life for the people that live a few doors down from her old house as she passes them by everyday as she pretends to go to work. She then learns the woman in said house is now missing. She was in the area that night but cannot remember anything because of a blackout. The story then goes on with Rachel trying to fill in the missing pieces that night.This story is told from three different pov. We have Rachel, the amnesiac alcoholic, Anne, the mistress and now wife of Rachel's ex, and Megan, the now missing woman with a lot of secrets. Most of the characters in this book are rather bleak. The only one I found likeable was Rachel's roomate. I think she may be the only sane one in the bunch. This book could be redundant at times with Rachel always drinking but never remember what happened. But she somehow found her way home each time.I give it three stars because it was an okay read. I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends but if you can't find anything to read this book can pass the time."
"This books is pretty good-- not amazing. Many others have already given a synopsis, so here are my pros/cons:Pros:-The book is a quick read and is entertaining.- I liked the overall story quite a bit (the writing style was lacking)- I hate when I solve the mystery too early. This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read. Not a must-read by any means, but I enjoyed the book."
"The movie, primarily because of Emily Blunt's acting, is much better than the novel.  Emily Blunt kept my interest.  The novel took way too long to get moving so that I was ""ho hum"" when are we going to get on with what's actually happening here. I gave the movie three stars because Blunt's five star performance averaged out the ho hum tediousness of the novel's story line.  I can't for the life of me figure out why the novel became such best seller."
"I have no problem tossing a book to the side after a couple of chapters if I don't like it. This one I wanted to throw across the room! I just can't understand the good reviews, but I had to keep reading to see if I could figure it out. I never did.I tried skimming once I got halfway through, but it wasn't easy. The book is told from the point of view of different characters but they all sound the same. Not to worry, you know you're reading about the main character if she is constantly worried about her next drink.This trend of going back and forth, writing chapters from the perspective of different characters and at different times (which she also does) can be the mark of a lazy writer. It takes time to create a single narrator, and I don't think this writer had the skill."
"I loved  this book I read it twice which I have never done before. if you were a heavy drinker or if you knew one in your life you will relate to Rachel, who is the main character in this book. the beginning was hard to follow for me. the book is told in three characters Rachel, megan, and anna. who by the way are all connected in  some way which you find out as you get to know these people. Rachel gives a lot of misinformation thru out the book aka blackouts dreams ect. related to her being an alcoholic which adds a Hitchcock feel to this story. it is a mystery novel . the book is slow in the beginning till you get to know who megan and anna  are, but hold on the book takes off like a running train lots of twists in this. Rachel was awesome throughout the whole book and the ending is awesome  I can't get Rachel out of my head!!! without giving anything away you will have a different perspective for Rachel and be amazed of what she can do in a crisis.  I hope there is sequel"
"This was a book I could not put down.That being said, in some ways, many ways in fact, it reminded me too much of Gone Girl.Perhaps this is the London version of Gone Girl.Girl on the Train is fast-paced, riveting and engrossing.I could not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. Rachel was a victim of her own habits, clumsy, dull, needy and relentlessly foolish in her behavior. I simply wanted to shake her and tell her to leave well enough alone, but then of course there would be no story, no conflict.Anna and Megan were shallow, greedy and wanting and taking what wasn't rightfully theirs to take. Megan's wanton nature did her in. Hers was a sad little life that might have turned out better if she had made better choices.Anna's life was a full circle, ""what goes around comes around"" tale.And the men were despicable brutish abusers!Seldom have I disliked so many characters in a novel!I did enjoy the book, but compared to Gone Girl it was a bit disappointing. It was written in the same style.. First one character's narrative, then another's, but the adversaries in Gone Girl were clearly more clever,  more attractive and even more resourceful.Though there were twists and turns, Girl on the Train was plodding in places and I really don't care what Rachel does next!"
"I heard this book being hyped as the next Gone Girl, but it definitely isn't.  It's a good book, don't get me wrong, but I just felt like the story was sloppy... Maybe because Rachel was so sloppy with her drinking and her behavior (and in turn her narration) but it's hard to get behind a character that is so non like-able.  Maybe if there had been more telling about her relationship with Tom in the beginning, so you are able to develop some sympathy for her before you meet her as a black out drunk.  I don't know.*SPOILERS*All that aside, I did spend the whole book trying to formulate who I thought was the culprit, and at one point I was thinking that it could have been Rachel that killed Megan so obviously the plot was well written and spun together.  I had suspicions early on about what was going on with Megan and I was right about those assumptions, but did not expect the end with Anna.So overall, a good read that kept my interest... the comparisons to Gone Girl though really set it up to disappoint some readers I think though."
"Truly keeps you guessing to the very end! I read this in 3 days, very surprising. Can't wait for the film."
I couldn't put the book down! There were twist and turns on each page. Never would have guessed who the killer is
I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
Loved it!
Both my mother and I read and enjoyed the story.  Look forward to reading another book by this author soon.
Started a bit slow and the middle was a bit boring and confusing towards the middle. Was shocked by the ending.
Couldn't let it go. Bestseller!
Good mystery telling the story from different points of view
Just get it.  A great read
Great read.
When I started reading I was like what is this but quickly I got taken in and then couldn't put it down. Great read
I did not really enjoy the book.  It seemed too long for the story.
Fabulous book
A page turner for sure! Great!
I enjoy thrillers and this book lived up to the hype. I was on the edge of my seat til the last page. Loved it!!
This was a great thriller! I  couldn't put it down.  Great escape!  I didn't want it to end. Great read!
Kept me guessing the whole time. I was on the edge of my seat. Never saw it coming. Good read!
Great book. Couldn't put it down.
I do recommend the book. It is easy to read and  keeps you in good suspense for a while. The end is a little predictable.
I enjoyed the way the novel was sewn and woven in time. It was a very improbable plot but empowering to know that the bully got his due.
I loved how well this book was written and the story.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves thrillers
"Hard to put down this weird, weird book!"
Excellent book.  Look forward to seeing the movie.
What a thriller. The book makes you think you know- until you don't! Great read. Can't wait to see the movie.
The main character was an alcoholic and  consequently she couldn't remember or justify her behavior.  Plot was confusing and weak.
"Good start, somewhat slow in the middle but an really unexpected ending!!! Wow!!!"
"A quick, intense and insane romp through the lives of a few folks who you know could be your neighbors...despite your hope that they are not."
"Anyone that likes multiple viewpoints of the same scene this book is for you. Intrigue, suspense, murder, and lust make this book intense and believable."
Fantastic book. Haven't seen the film but the book was great
Loved this book...it keeps interests and moves very well. one if those hard to out down books.
I enjoyed this book. I liked the character development. I did have to go back from time to time to see which character I was reading about and the story was choppy at times but I loved the final chapters and couldn't put it down since I just had to know what was going to happen. I liked the premise of someone on a train fantasizing about the lives of the people they watch daily from a train window. I hope to read more from this author.
"Overall liked the book - but it is not something I would re-visit as (1) There is not too much sub-text or character details that I want to re-visit after the reveal and  **spoilers ahead**(2) though there is some attempt at describing and analyzing issues related to infertility, baby death, alcoholism, the author does not dig too deeply to surface the complexity around them. For e.g. it would have been great to know more about the killer - not the motivation, which was clearly laid out, but just more about the killer's tastes, personality, etc.The multiple narrator touch seems to be a new thing in literature, especially the unreliable-female-narrator. It works for a larger extent, but of course, I can sense the struggle that the author might go through with trying not to reveal too many spoilers.Recommended for its good premise and pace. Made some difficult reading for me as some of the issues mentioned drove home."
"Except with Hitchcock I haven't read a compelling book that gives the reader a separate scene that allows complete third person omniscient perspective. On this train Rachel rides daily into London to a job she lost months ago. Her perspective out of the train window and when the train stops she can peek into the homes and lives of two separate families. On the train back to her flat, she often begins drinking canned gin and tonics that eventually lead to her alcoholic black outs. She is obsessive about her lost life with her ex-husband, her infertility and a mystical couple who live a few doors down from her previous home.Not only does Rachel observe the back terraces, but she notices clothes and oddities that are discarded by the train tracks below her.As the story unfolds, Hawkins develops each character into deeper, darker aspects of what we first know. Rachel is written to be dark from the beginning, however what the reader doesn't expect is the other characters are equally complex and dark.I highly recommend this book. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the editing, e.g., misspelled words, incorrect word choice (then versus than). That flaw was distracting, but not so much as I didn't finish the book."
"Warning: This is not a happy book. It takes place in a suburb of London and is full of broken people living broken lives. However, how these broken people are revealed and how they all relate to a murder is what makes the book interesting. The mystery is told from three different women’s points of view, each telling their story in the first person. It can get little confusing, especially when they jumble time periods, but you slowly learn the whole story by listening to each one. I was intrigued in the first third, bored somewhat by Rachel’s interminable alcohol black-outs in the middle, but then was gripped through the final third as the full truth began to be revealed. It has almost no action (until the end) and is mostly a lot of sad people talking about their sad lives, but the way the author broke up this murder mystery made it interesting. Kind of how I feel about the romance in the movie “500 Days of Summer” where the story is pretty simple but the reveal is the fascinating part. So I enjoyed it, but don’t read it if you need a lift of your spirits! 3-1/2 stars out of 5."
"This book was ok. The blackouts of the main character seem a stretch, especially toward the end of the book. While I like the premise of the story unfolding through different character voices, the development of each character is shallow. You know each of the characters has demeaning, undesirable qualities, but they are just blah and predictable. The only nice character, Cathy, comes across as a doormat.As the book progresses, it becomes very predictable, which is disappointing. Without divulging too much information about specific characters, I felt at loose ends wondering what happened with some of the remaining characters. The ending was somewhat abrupt, almost as if the author had reached her quoto of pages and decided to call it quits before tying up the loose ends.I did see some style, plot, and character similarities  between this author and Gillian Flynn, however, Flynn's writing is more developed. I wouldnt say the book was a total wash, but I fail to understand the rave reviews."
"I read the reviews on this book. People comparing it to Gone Girl and such. Well I thought the book was pretty good, but it was no Gone Girl.The main character is hard to like. She exudes self pity and naïveté to a degree that sometimes makes you roll your eyes. I get it. Things are hard and she is confused. We've all probably felt that way. It's just ... Well I wasn't against her but I wasn't exactly cheering for her either.There is a neat little twist near the end of this book that did surprise me and ultimately I was satisfied at the ending.This book is good beach reading. I wouldn't call it riveting and it is easy to feel depressed as the story unfolds and you get caught up in the messes of these peoples' lives. But it's interesting enough to slog through to the end. I was glad to be done with it though."
"I originally wrote a very short review complaining that the author lifted the idea of her book from Agatha Crhistie.I'm editing this now because I think readers need to know some specific negatives about this, especially in the Kindle edition.About the novel: This is sort of a psychological mystery. It provides great suspense until midway, then it falls flat.  We think we have a complex, scary kind of lady on this train and that she is up to no good. In fact, the plot of the story is way less interesting and the mysterious crackpot isn't.I don't know why Hawkins uses triple narration. It does not move the story forward, in fact, the story doesn't know what direction it's going with this style narration. I kept saying, okay, when is this taking place, and thinking I have a chronology when I don't.Reading this in Kindle is excruciating. In a book, I'd be flipping pages backwards to check on who said what, when, and in regard to whom. With Kindle, you can only Go To a location or a page and Lord knows how you figure that out from the Table of Contents.If you think you'd like to read this, for godssakes don't buy it for Kindle."
Was I the only person who thought this book was terrible? Aside from being completely implausible (but not ridiculous enough to be entertaining or diabolical enough to be disturbing) the protagonist was annoying. I hate to describe a character so teenager like but there really isn't much of a redemption in her character or a better way to say it. She's self aware enough and self loathing enough that I couldn't relate or empathize. I struggled to finish this book.
"Yes, it is similar to Gone Girl, but Gone Girl is much better.The Girl on a Train starts amazingly and is seductive at the beginning, but at the third of it, starts losing its power. The story is narrated by three women and you cannot distinguish their voices. All of them describe, tell and narrate exactly in the same way, so it's like they don't have a personality of their own. At some point the descriptions are a little boring, and the action is missing.In summary, it starts great, then it falls, but the ending is fine. It actually makes a clear feminist statement. The topics that you can analyze from the book are many and they are relevant, the idea is ver good, but something is missing."
"This author certainly knows how to weave a sad tale of loneliness, sadness and how one person's selfish, evil acts can affect the lives of so many others. This book is definetly a page turner. After a certain point I knew who the killer was, but did not expect the person who steps up in the end to do so. The story line does keep your interest, but I had to put it down every few chapters and take a break from the main character's sadness. To me that speaks of the author's ability to absorb you into her words. I gave this book 4 stars because, even though it is well written and certainly worth reading, I do not have any interest in reading it again, I only rate books I would re-read 5 stars."
"I liked the book.  Held my interest all the way through, but I found the ending to be a bit disappointing, and somewhat contrived."
A LITTLE CONFUSING AT TIMES.
Engaging with enough twists to make you wonder. Slow start but amount of moving pieces pulls you in. Good summer read.
A little boring and frustrating in parts
"Original, inventive, puzzling book that explores the thought processes around a suburban woman's bleak life."
"I know The Girl on the Train has gotten rave reviews, but when you get right down to it, it's a boring read.  I would not recommend it."
Hard to stop reading!
I thought it was good but it took me a while to get through because I kept getting confused.
not as good as I thought. Kept waiting for something to happen. Ending was typical mystery ending.
Omniscient voice would have been much easier to follow. And I jut couldn't make myself care about Rachel until the lat two chapters.
"This is an exciting read.  I like the way the chapters are divided up by the characters of the narrative, all of them women.  And, the women are not entirely likable.  I found myself unsympathetic at times, but drawn to their flaws, dramas, and insecurities.  It was a view of modern women but not the most modern of sensibilities--a pseudo-'60's millennial feel for one of the characters.  I don't want to give anything away, but one habit I had was to constantly check the dates of the narrative, whomever the author was focusing on--it goes back and forth, and drives the narrative forward and makes it suspenseful, but a bit hard to keep track of. What I liked about the read is that I commute daily to work on a train--reading standing up in a crowded train, sitting down, even missed my stop a couple of times.  Definitely worth reading..."
"Poor alcoholic Rachel.  As she commutes daily on a train, heading towards a job she longer has, passing the same scenes daily, she creates a world of her own.  She fills it with characters that she assigns the perfect life, the perfect love.  Filling worthless, filled with longing for her ex husband and jealousy for his current wife and their new baby, she's witness to a murder.  Of course she's viewed with doubt.  After all she's an unreliable drunk who suffers blackouts and is obssessed with her ex husband's life. She sounds crazy and is viewed as such.  Twists and turns.  Some surprises.  I began to suspect who the murderer was half way through the book.  Still a good read that I kept going back to.  I felt real sorrow for Rachel.  Unable to move forward with her life, unable to admit that her past life is over, unable to decipher what memory is real and what is blurred by wine.  First time I have read htis aurthur.  I would read her again. Her characters are believable and I wanted to find out what happens to them"
"Wonderful idea, poorly executed towards the end. I really wanted to like this, but the last half of the book DRAGGED. Maybe one good reveal every 45 minutes (used the audio book). It also started to feel a little messy and disorganized with the jumping perspectives and timelines. 3 stars because while a solid half of the book was annoying, I enjoyed the tail end."
"As I started this book,I was sure that I reading the story from someone who had suffered a major head trauma and was trying to remember something that was important at a place she no longer lived at.  I didn't realize that there was 3 different women telling different but connecting tales. One was an alcoholic, another a stay at home mom whose husband she stole from his wife (the alcoholic), and emotional distressed wife, having an affair with the husband of the other two. One of these women winds up dead .The solving of her murder falls to the other two because of their connection.  My impression of Rachel,the girl on the train, leaves me hoping there is a better future for those who try"
"I tried so hard to like this story and stick it out, because I hate to give up on a book. Rachel, Anna, Jess/ Megan, Scott and whoever else ( ex hubby) were just so unlikeable. I couldn't identify with any of them because the protagonist was....well a train wreck from the beginning to end, and as far as I was concerned never got back on track. I understand being in love and having ones heart broken and everything else she was going through was awful, but it was really hard to identify with her on any level, because I didn't like her, and I tried. I didn't like her roommate either, who pops up a lot in the story. Towards the end when the truth came out it could've been exhilarating because I wasn't really expecting that, but personally I was just glad this train had pulled into the station and I could step off! Felt like all these characters should of been tied to the railway tracks,  Not much to say, it was a page turner, but only because I wanted to get to the end as fast as I could !"
"I think the most surprising portion of the book encompasses Rachel's past. The complex, and tragic way the characters connect was interesting and made me want to read more.I will say that I called the ending. There was a portion of Megan's narration that just made it click. Of course, the book then distracts you into other appealing ideas, but they never quite pan out.The characters can be a bit of an annoyance. Rachel can be frustrating since she readily makes things more difficult for herself, and Anna is just a terrible person. When she talks, the malice is tangible.Overall, I did like it. I mean, I read it in two days, and I'm still looking forward to the film."
"Rachel Watson is the miserable poster woman for a Borderline Personality-disordered alcoholic who is depressed, anxious and has no redeemable qualities as a human being.  The premise itself is interesting; the point of view of the voyeuristic train passenger who imagines the lives of those living along the tracks of her daily commute.  Rachel finds herself in the middle of a mystery she feels compelled to participate in as a main character.  Just when you think her obnoxious and unreliable participation will actually contribute to something positive and meaningful - you are reminded that she is so shallow and self-serving that nothing good will come from her interference.  The other characters are equally as shallow and self-serving.  Although the book is very well-written and certainly interesting in it's telling, I couldn't help but be distracted by the fact that everyone was unlikable.  Ultimately, I was disappointed in the fact that Rachel never became a better person and we never learned the source of her sociopathic behavior. There was no one to root for  (not even the police) and in the end I am baffled as to why everyone was as deranged as they were."
"Great novel to read by the pool, which is just what I did today. I caught the twist earlier than I was supposed to, but it didn't ruin the outcome for me. Being American, I liked the small differences in the language. Otherwise, the  story could have taken in Anyplace, Anywhere. The trains add an nice change of scenery. I'm rambling, but it's so hard to write a review like this without spoilers. Bottom line, I enjoyed this book and will recommend it to others!"
"The first half of The Girl on the Train was great. The characters were believable and their intersecting narratives helped to drive the novel forward. However, about half-way through the book, just about everything falls apart. The characters start engaging in activities that are contrived and clearly not believable.  (Is it even remotely believable that the main character would have sex with one of the other main characters?  (Note: I'm being intentionally cryptic to avoid spoilers)).  At that point, the narrative becomes strained and intentionally drawn out.  Finally, it is a well-known device of poorly written mysteries for the killer to ""tell all"" near the end of the novel.  The best mysteries lay out all of the pieces of evidence as they proceed and there's no need for the killer to engage in revelations at the end of the book because everything has already been laid out.  I raced through the last third of this book simply because I wanted to be finished and move on to something more rewarding."
"This is one of the best mysteries or novels I have read in a long time.  The story is about a woman, Rachel, who has been destoyed by the betrayal by her husband.  He left her for another woman and he and the new wife now have a baby.  This was a goal which Rachel dreamed of even spending thousands on experimental fertility procedures.  Her husband claims they couldn't spend anymore for that, but that it was all right to take expensive vacations..  After the divorce, Rachel drinks too much and loses her job.  However, she continues to ride the train into London making believe she is still employed.  Each day she passes her old neighborhood, an upscale subdivision where her ex-husband now lives in her house with his new wife and baby.  Down the street is another couple, a beautiful perfect couple, and Rachel begins to dream that this could have been her and her husband if only her dreams turned out.The author spins a story of intrigue and lies among married couples and the terrible tricks that are played.  She drops clues along the way, and the reader needs to be watchful and gather them up.  I recommend this very highly.  I believe this is a first novel, and I can't wait to read Ms. Hawkins next book."
"SPOILERS AHEAD.Better than expected! I didn't think the characters would be as well and fully developed as they were. My only issue was with the reveal of whodunnit at the end. I won't give it away entirely, but the person who actually committed the murder behaves completely opposite of how an actual person with their mental issues would behave. The author paints the person like a children's-story villain, not an actual human with the issues that would compel them to behave in the manner that they behave.Otherwise, everyone else acted and thought and behaved in a manner consistent with actual human psychology, and I was very impressed."
"While the novel is entertaining and one of those books you can read in a day, and though it keeps the reader in suspense some of the time, the prose is quite prosaic and the ending overly melodramatic (and in some sense a bit absurd-- as if written for a Hollywood blockbuster). Most of the characters are wholly unbelievable and superficial, and in some sense the gender stereotypes the book promotes has set us all back at least a few decades. Overall, the book was a quick read and it was, admittedly, gripping up until the last couple of chapters-- just as a bestseller produced for mass consumption should be. Beyond that, it cannot be defined as art or true literature, as intellectually pretentious that may sound."
"I'd looked at this title and read the blurb many times before I relented and bought the book.  I think I've been reading too much to know the difference between good writing and bad.  While the pride flowed well in this book it was often times confusing.  Jumping between dates, Megan, Rachel, and Anna, I often find myself flipping back pages to see if what I was reading happened before or after doomsday.  Then when I got about 75% done, the bad guy became blatantly obvious.  No real physiological twist there.  I guess this is a good book.  It spent too many weeks on the NYT bestseller list to not be, right?  And it's already been optioned for a movie.  Have readers in general just gotten easier to please?"
"This thriller sucked me in. I loved how slowly the author unraveled the layers for the reader but still left enough questions to keep the reader doubting and questioning their own conclusions. I also applaud her strong multifaceted characterizations of all the female characters. They are all flawed but also real and they lack any shallow pretense. There is a melancholy intensity to all of them without being trite amd I appreciated them and the writing and story more for it.Writing from different character perspectives is difficult to achieve successfully but Hawkins does a great job of it.Highly recommend this book if you enjoy the combination of sharp, smart writing and thrillers."
"This book really had me captured and sucked into the story. I would have read it straight through if I could have. The writer had me constantly trying to figure out who the ""bad guy"" was. I think that the writing was superb and the book kept me guessing.I highly recommend reading this book. It was full of suspense, drama, and a lot of twists and turns. Worth the money that I spent. The only downside is that the author gives your first person narrative of 3 women in the book and from time to time I had to keep flipping back to the beginning of the chapter because I'd forget the time line and who was narrating. The book has a lot of flash backs so it can get confusing at times. But over all I highly recommend this book!"
"I read this book mostly because I like to read books that are about to become a movie and feel like I've beaten the suspense of waiting for it to come out! anyways, I don't know what all the big fuss is about! I mean it's a good story and all, I didn't see that ending coming but I started to figure it out about 3/4 of the book. I got the audiobook version so the listen is always good! I get a good sense of the characters by who is doing the dialogue. I just felt like the story was being dragged on! I feel like it could've been shorter and we still could've gotten the same ending! I mean I get it! She's a terrible alcoholic but it just kept being dragged on and on! But again this is not my typical read, so for what it was worth it was ok. I think you'll be ok if you just want to wait for the movie though!"
"This was a nice, well rounded story with plenty to keep me reading. There wasn't too much going on and it was a pleasure to follow. Having said that, I didn't get what all of the hype is about with this book. It wasn't that powerful. The story itself was a great concept and told in 1st, 2nd and 3rd person. Rachel is a strong character and so is Megan and Anna.Rachel though, seems depressed and I think she's a little jealous of her ex's new situation. His new wife, a brand new baby. They moved into Rachel and Tom's old house and then he posts pictures on FB about how happy they are. Sad, but he isn't wrong for doing it. Everyone does it and though he and her didn't work out it isn't his fault that she is jealous or depressed.I had no idea beforehand how the end would come about and certainly don't want to spoil it here but it wasn't as strong in the suspense aspect as other rival novels in its genre and I couldn't wait to be done with it. I think this book tries really hard but it just can't get it done. It's not Gone Girl and it never will be. But It was still worth the read if you like books in this genre, though I expected more of a racy, suspenseful experience."
A very disappointing read I found myself telling the characters to get a life.  It took me a couple chapters before I realized that there were three different girls as their voices were so similar. They make the most stupid spur of the moment decisions that get them into really bad situations especially Rachel and Megan. Anna is a piece of work I didn't like her at all.  I really didn't like any of the characters in this book and I found it very depressing and had to make myself finish it.  A few other people I spoke to about the book said that they couldn't finish it and that if I did I should tell them what happened. I am curious to see how they have made this into a movie.
"Honestly, I just don't like you. Yeah, you.... Rachel, Anne and Megan!I don't like your guys, husbands, and boyfriends in this book, either! In fact, I don't like ANYONE in this book!Does the writer make attempts at creating sympathy for some of these characters? Yeah...sort of. But there is a general disgust for everyone that is hard to shake off. I must admit, in the first couple chapters there is a fascinating draw to the narrative that did keep me reading...and reading...making me nauseous sometimes, sick and disgusted by stupid choices of our narrator, and then I became bored in the middle.I wanted to finish it, but I was sick of reading it. I put it down (metaphorically, since it's a Kindle) read something else and came back to finish it.And the finish was good. SCARY GOOD and mostly satisfying. No spoilers, sweetie! Just if you are looking for a book where you root for character and want to CARE for a main character, well....this ain't your book, baby. Much like Gone Girl where the unreliable narrative and unlikeable characters drive the story, this one has me shaking my head and drinking Pellegrino water!"
"Reading The Girl on the Train is like peeling an onion. The deeper you get into the story, the closer you get to understanding the central characters.  The main character, Rachel, is struggling on many levels. Half the time I was frustrated with her and the other half I wondered how and when she would regain her memory of that night when Megan disappeared and the part she might have played.  One of the most important elements of the plot is time. I would recommend that readers remember the key date, July 13, to keep from getting lost because Hawkins skillfully moves the plot in concentric circles around that date.  This is a page-turner. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"This is an excellent psychological thriller about an alcoholic and her imaginations from riding a train daily.  She gets involved in making up stories about a couple who live on the train route as she longs for her ex-husband who lives on the same street.  As a recovering alcoholic, I found it a little difficult to live through her drunken sprees and blackouts but it all comes together in the end with the unexpected ending. Highly recommend it."
"I've had this book and in my library for a few months now. It was recommended but I just wasn't feeling it. A friend was starting to read it, so I thought I'd join her and we could talk about it. Well I started on a Monday and finished on Wednesday! It's one of those books that you have to pay attention to the details, the dates, the names, etc...  It was an easy read, kept me on my toes and suspense filled. Excited to see what they do with the movie."
"Turning ""Girl on a Train"" into a movie is a new high/low in redundancy because it reads like a movie script, anyway; a novel for readers who like a lot of TV.  The characters are believable because they're ordinary, and they're easily forgotten because they don't say or do anything remarkable, clever, or challenging.  The device of the train is not exactly new, but a good writer with a feel for mystery and compelling characters could run with its possibilities.  The protagonist, Rachel, is an alcoholic filled with self-pity.  She is currenly exhausting the patience of her last codependent friend.  Oh, it's no use trying to review a book this shallow.  If only it had some wit or even a point."
"This book really wowed me.  I found it simply by seeing it listed on Amazon.  I didn't read a review, just took a gamble.  I don't read a lot of thrillers, but want to read more after this one.  Don't compare this to Gone Girl - it's way better, and way difference.  I really wanted to binge read this one, I wish I could have.  The characters were richly drawn, although sad in some cases, and the story was engrossing.  The story revolves around a woman not remembering critical (and potentially dangerous) events because she was black-out drunk, which was really unique and interesting - you got the sense of frustration on the main character's part to try and put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Loved it.....highly recommended."
"First and foremost, the writing in this book is bad. By the end of the first page, I knew it wouldn't even come close to living up to the hype and Gone Girl comparisons. The writing does not grab you or keep your attention, so finishing the book felt more like a chose than something I was interested in doing.The characters and the plot are poorly developed. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Several of the plotlines end up being completely pointless (ie they had nothing to do with the final ""twist"" or the fate of the main character).. I guess they are supposed to increase suspense but in my opinion reading the book was similar to the experience of watching someone bake a delicious cake and then throwing it away. I kept reading even though I was bored because I anticipated a shocking twist and interesting resolution (probably in large part because of all the Gone Girl comparisons), but the story never picks up steam or becomes interesting.Ultimately, I would advise against reading this.. if you're like me, you'll probably read it anyway because of all the hype, but it's really not worth your time."
"A disturbing feeling. That's how I describe reading the life of the girl on the train. Her interest in complete strangers, a young couple who live on the same street as her ex husband and his new wife, is voyeuristic and downright creepy. She goes so far as to name them and imagine their relationship. This beginning sets up a dysfunctional mix of two neighboring couples and the ever watchful girl on the train--the ex-wife who is alcoholic and rides the train every morning to pretend she is still working a job so her roommate won't kick her out. In between her binges she puzzles over missing segments of her life that she fidgets with until convinced she has the missing part to the murder of the neighbor wife. If you like a snoop into  the lives of unstable, violent, and bizarre behavior this is your novel. The talent of the author that intrigued me was withholding information and weaving snippets of supposed truth throughout. At least it made me read to the end. This is a read with no literary merit. And personally, I would rather not have had these people enter my life. I found it disturbing and unsettling."
"It isn't hard to put yourself in the position of the narrator. Every day you ride the same train on the same route with the same people into the same huge city where you're another anonymous cog in the wheel. Your sense of being invisible has become literal; you no longer care what passengers think of you as you open the gins and tonic (they're sold in cans in England) that will make the day go by in a pleasant fog. As far as you're concerned, you're a nobody. And each time the train passes your ex-husband's house, which used to be yours, you know that you're nobody. You see the new wife, the one he was seeing before he left you. And you notice that the daughter they had is getting bigger.So, you've trained yourself to look a few houses down. There's a woman sitting in her front garden. Some mornings she's reading; other times she's drinking a cup of tea. The man who comes out and joins her is not bad looking, and so, with nothing else to do you start to make up stories about the lives of the couple. After all, if you were still married, you'd be neighbors. And you decide that you'd be friends. Until. One morning. When everything changes."
"Very slow getting started.  With alternating narrators and dates that are important but sometimes jump back and forth, I wished I were reading a book instead of my Kindle.  I ended up taking notes to avoid significant confusion.  I took notes up to about 41%.  By then everything was pretty easy to follow, but the dates continued to be critically important.  Once I got to 49% I was deeply involved and it was intense and enjoyable and I finished in about 24 hours, during which I did other things as well.  It was somewhat like Gone Girl although I ended up liking this and I totally hated Gone Girl because I didn't care if either character lived or died, in fact I wish she had died at the end.  These characters, while flawed people were at least sympathetic."
"I have mixed feelings about this novel. Like Gone Girl, it is a dark, surprising tale, and like Gone Girl, this novel features unreliable narration. Beyond that, I'm not so sure why there are so many comparisons between the two novels. I enjoyed the multiple points of view, and I appreciated that the characters were drawn with such unapologetic realism and complexity. That being said, there wasn't one likeable character in the entire novel, and while reading it, I desperately wished for just one positive nuance in any one of the characters. I also found that because this book was told out of chronological order, the various dates became difficult to keep up with. I was utterly delighted by the ending. I never once guessed what was actually going to happen, and in a novel of this level of dark suspense, that is a tremendous achievement. If you enjoy unreliable narration or a good, dark psychological thriller like Gone Girl or Mudvein, then I definitely think this book is worth the read. I will be very interested to see what Ms. Hawkins writes next."
"...and I cannot say anymore without completely spoiling it. In the beginning, it looked like a mystery built exclusively around the weakness of two of the main characters (one alcoholic with blackouts, one manic pixie dream girl wannabe unreliable narrator), but the slow burn ending and the perspective of the very sensible, cold and practical third protagonist brings on the reread element, just for kicks and foreshadowing.Only four stars because all of the characters (except Cathy, who is a cinnamon roll too good for this world) rely heavily on the reproduction / maternity angle for background issues and motivation, and I personally find it a bit of a cliché. It is still a great read!"
"While I typically don't take the time to write reviews of novels, since I feel a good review should include more thoughtful analysis than, ""this was a good book"" or ""I recommend it"", I feel the need to review this book. While I was inspired to purchase this book due to the abundance of positive reviews, I was quite disappointed. The story was flat, uninspiring. I heard that it will be turned into a motion picture, which makes me question, how many of the scenes will be of a disheveled alcoholic sitting on a train (doesn't sound too exciting of a movie)?The book was a quick read, I finished it over the course of weekend. You won't walk away with a profound understanding of alcoholics or anything of that nature. I say skip the book and just wait for the movie to come out, that way you'll waste less of your time."
I found the lead character was an alcoholic stalker who needed serious help. She should have been reported for stalking a long time ago. That said life is full of people like her and the other weird abusers unfortunately.The book was nothing like I expected and I  did appreciate the style it was written in. Some of it was predictable with character personalities to who did it. I guess my rating is due to expecting more from all of the hype it got.
"One of the best books I've read in a really long time. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie, and I'm glad I did. They were both fantastic, but I think reading the book first gave me a better interpretation of the movie. Though the plot was twisted and dark, the characters were incredibly engrossing. As more and more information came to light, the plot just became more and more enticing. It is a little easy to see the ending coming from about halfway through, but there are enough other things going on that it doesn't take away from the read. It's just unbelievable to me that this is a debut novel because it's such an amazing read."
"Really, really good...better than I expected really, and with a lot of psychological complexity that doesn't fully come clear until the payoff at the end. Honestly found parts of it difficult to read. I normally really struggle with books about addiction or with addicts as main characters...much less narrators...so it's really a tribute to the writing that I found it impossible to put down, in spite of that.While I suspected/guessed aspects of that ending, that psychological complexity I mentioned still made the payoff really worthwhile. I found myself thinking about layers of that days later, in terms of the dimensionality of the characters themselves. I don't want to say too much due to the spoiler thing, but anyone who knows anything about trauma and how it affects people will probably pick up on a lot of this, especially in relation to the Rachel character and her spiral following her divorce.A great mystery story...and a great psychological thriller. I'll definitely be looking out for more by this author!"
"I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The characters are shallow and boring. The ""girl""  and other  female characters are weak and present as victims. They have been mistreated, but fall into the don't help yourself mode of dealing with their circumstances. That's not me. The structure of the book felt contrived- as in I don't have an interesting tale so I'll add a confusing format. The telling was tedious and only got interesting near the end and then there was some additional prose that seemed to have no purpose as an ending. I'm sure it will be an entertaining movie w the right actors, but the book was a flop for me."
"I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but the only thing holding me back was that I thought that the ending wasn't as detailed as the rest of the book and felt a little rushed. However, it didn't detract from the story and the story was fabulous in every way!  It took me about 3 or 4 chapters to get my head around who the main character was. It would have been helpful to have a little notebook handy and write down which character and date I was reading as the chapters jump back and forth a bit just as they did in Gone Girl and initially I found it difficult to follow but it is well worth persevering. Rachel, the main character is fascinating to follow as she embeds herself in the lives of others and tackles her own issues at the same time. I started to determine the answers to the mystery about halfway through and was pretty sure about it at about the three quarter mark. I would have liked the story to have given a bit more detail around the character of Megan as it would have been nice to see what made her tick also. Overall, a great and entertaining story. I would recommend reading if you like a psychological drama/thriller."
"I have not been able to get completely absorbed by a crime novel in a long time. If you add the fact that I tend to be a contrarian reader, i.e. I tend NOT to read what everyone raves about, I was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed this little masterpiece.Story is all told in the first person by the three main female characters, which keeps the pace fast enough to keep you turning pages but also gives you pause to think and absorb. You will probably figure out the culprit as you start delving into the thick of the book, but it doesn't really matter: Anna, Rachel and Megan will make you grimace, smile, cringe and always find a way to reach inside of you. That's the most stunning feature of this book: I read many novels that made me connect with THE main character, but I have seldom found myself in the shoes of all the key characters.My final piece of advice: pick it up before you go on vacation, or off for long relaxing weekend, maybe if you have long train commutes (ahem) ahead of you. I promise you'll be so captured you'll struggle to put you Kindle down."
"Now I see why The Girl On The Train is this year's Gone Girl.  Rachel rides the train daily to London, watching one particular couple as she passes their house.  She playfully names them Jess and Jason and creates their own perfect fantasy marriage.  But one day, the lady of the house is nowhere to be seen.  Rachel suspects foul play.  She confronts the police and nearby neighbors.  There's one huge catch: Rachel has a drinking problem.  She's an unreliable witness, and has an ugly past with the neighborhood.  If she keeps prying, Rachel could become the next headline.  Written from the perspective of Rachel, Anna and Megan, Hawkins displays her Train ladies as journal entries, taken in morning and evening segments.  Will anyone ever believe Rachel, especially the fateful night she can't quite remember?  Is Anna really the sweet, caring, overprotective mom?  And what about Megan, the missing artist with the twisted past?  Hitchcock in its styling, with enough red herrings to open an aquarium, and a tarnished heroine the reader can root for, The Girl On The Train is well worth the ticket. I can't wait for the movie!"
"On the cover of this book SJ Watson calls it 'Gripping, enthralling - a top-notch thriller and a compulsive read'. I agree 100%I simply could not put this book down.It is well written - tight, tense and thrilling all the way. Reading it is like riding a roller coaster.Who is telling the truth?Who is lying?Rachel, an emotionally unstable alcoholic who has recently lost her marriage and her job, rides the train to London every day, keeping up the pretence she still has a job.Everyday she passes the back of the street where she used to live - when she was married - and every day she looks.She makes up stories about the people in the houses - one couple in particular.Then one day she sees something; something that changes the way she sees these people and that will involve her in their lives.A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller; this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories.I have read some really good books this year, but this is far and away the best."
"The premise of the story about watching people and their lives while on a train appealed to me. I can imagine making up stories about the people you would see every day.  However, I found I was not looking forward to reading it. The author kept going back and forth with dates and flashbacks and I found myself backtracking to see what date we were on. The story developed too slowly and the characters were just not all that interesting. I put the book down after reading more than half of it. I was just not enjoying it. I will not read another book by this author."
"It was a good read because I never read another story like this but, the characters were awful. Not one person, except the room-mate, had any good character traits so I found the story went nowhere. I found myself not caring about what happened to any one of these deplorable people. I also found the ending anticlimactic because it didn't matter who did what- the story could have gone in almost any direction without any surprise ending."
"The story is ok in a twisty / turning kind of way.  Since the reader jumps between 3 characters POV, we sometimes see the same event multiple times, from different perspectives.  I didn't have a problem with the story, which is a very convoluted "" who dunnit,"" with an incredibly dull and predictable ending.  Rather I found the characters flat and underdeveloped.  There are three voices, and they all sound exactly the same.  But for Ms. Hawkins telling you what character is narrating, you'd never know which woman is which.  The three narrators are given slightly unique traits: one's a drinker, the other has a baby and the last one is missing.  The audio book was superior because three women narrated so they had actual unique voices, which helped differentiate the otherwise similar characters.I wouldn't recommend the book, but if you need something to while away a short plane ride, it isn't terrible."
"Here's the deal. There is no doubt that the author is an amazing at describing places, people. and things, as well as developing inner thoughts. However, like the title, it began slowly as if the train is starting to move, and then the rhythm begins which is a good thing. What weighed me down was that there was not one strong character that took the lead. I could not connect to whiney women, and men I knew little about. The good news is that if you're a woman, you'll identify with the ""I'm every woman"" concept that carries through the novel. Nothing is new under the sun here, except finding ""whodunnit."" The novel could another editing go around as there are missing words that slow the read.  If you're a Hawkins fan, you know that there will be a whole bunch of reality mixed in with some mystery."
"Although the style of writing from each character's point of view is something we have all seen before, this novel really allows this method to develop the characters.  The reader gets to see, from all angles, what is happening.  The plot keeps you guessing:  I must have changed my mind seven times in trying to figure out who was responsible.  You definitely can elate to our main character's perspective when on the train, in particular if you ever were or are currently a commuter.  You get involved with her thoughts and you realize that you may have done the same type of fantasizing in your travels.  A few twist, but not so many that you get lost.  A good, fast read."
"Very well written and easy to follow in spite of the fact that it was told in first person by each of three different women from each of their perspectives.  The chapter would be titled with the first name of whichever woman was talking and it would go back and forth. Even though this sounds confusing, it was not.  None of the characters were particularly lovable, just flawed in their own ways.  It was very suspenseful and moved the reader along well.  Except for being the tiniest bit drawn out, it was very hard to put down.  I didn't figure out the ending before the point at which they wanted me to know the ending, and that's always good.  Would recommend it to fans of suspenseful novels and murder mysteries.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this as well."
"The main characters are all women.  The problem is that they are all so sick.  I could not ""root"" for any one of them.  I always need a character that I like and am on there side.  But no, not is this case The writing as a skill did not particularly create any differences between in any of the three women.  They were all one dimensional.  I know who the killer is and the killer is of course-sick.  Oh well,  it will help me like the next book on the night stand"
"I read reviews about how good a book this was; otherwise, I would never have bought it.  The reviews, however, are hyped, overstated in terms of the ""suspense"" and ""leaving you guessing at every moment.""  That is why I gave this book 4 stars, along with the complexity of the novel.  I read the entire thing in two sittings over 8 hours last Friday, but I had to keep reading to keep all the stuff straight--who was doing what, etc.  I almost had to draw a picture to keep track of what was going on.  The book is told from the perspectives of three women:  Rachel, Megan, and Anna.  So you always had to keep in mind what perspective you were reading.  Then whoever was telling the story, was dated and timed, like August  5, 2013, early morning, mid morning, evening, etc.  And then the next section might be July 5, 2013, so you had to think, ""Oh, yeah, this is one month before the last section, but now it is from a different woman's perspective.""  See how confusing this gets?"
"The novel is perfectly paced, even though I know some who said it was really slow in the beginning. I, personally, prefer when the author takes us into the minds of his/her characters, showing us who they are, what they want, what they dream about. I like a slow burn. I don’t need to jump into the action on page three. But it is just me.The main female characters are drawn beautifully. One is an obsessed wreck of a woman. Another is a manic, complicated and a very unhappy girl. Finally, the third woman is a mistress who becomes the second wife, and who gleefully gloats about it. What’s not to love about this assemble of women?The story is twisted. The plot is tight. The main narrator is unreliable because most of the time she is drunk and cannot remember anything. Important details are presented to us methodically. Our fist impressions of each character are slowly warped by each unexpected and twisty revelation. You will question everything and everyone.In the end, however, you will be greatly satisfied. The ending is immaculate."
"It's hard to give a book 3 stars when it really kept me tied to my Kindle. But there's a strange dichotomy here. It's a rather dark thriller which kept me guessing until about page 170, where I sort of guessed how things meshed together. But I did not like the characters. Apart from aspects of Scott, I could not feel the empathy a reader should have with at least one or two characters. Rachel, the alcoholic, is one of those women who seem to moan and whine and irritate people. She irritated me, and her frequent and total blackouts after binge drinking were not always convincing. Anna is such a typical weak and clingy type -- but at the very end she's suddenly this amazingly strong woman just when the reader expects her to fall apart. Megan's psychiatrist remains a very vague figure, as does Megan herself. In fact, Megan is the least convincing character.But hey, there's a murder ...nuff said, I don't want to spoil the book for you. The atmosphere right through is somewhat depressing and humour is completely absent. But I guarantee you -- the book will still keep you reading until the very last page."
"The writer has infused life into the most wretched of characters. The ugliness, the mediocrity of everyday lives becomes interesting. There is no glamour, no great beauty, no riches, no great philosophy revealed, or perfect and passionate love obtained. The author reveals that humanity in its rawest form, at its humblest moments has a story worth telling. In our every day lives the stories are not revealed, even when we play a part in them, we don't always  understand the story or our roles within it.  The author helps us to step back and view the lives of these characters, understanding their stories and leaving us with the desire to examine our own stories and the characters in them a little more closely. This book is a good read. Like a train trip, it is a pleasant and strangely comforting ride. The epiphany is not actually arriving at the destination but is broken up into tiny bits, distributed in observations and insights discovered during the ride."
I haven't re it yet but my wife loved it and couldn't put it down.
Not my style.
I really enjoyed it
"awfully coincidental, but page turner"
Really enjoyed the book.
Very good book!
Just ok.
"Love, love this book."
I love it.
Would not get my nose out of
Good plight
Pretty much fantastic.
Could not get into it.
"The plot, such as it was, was rife with holes and inconsistencies. There wasn't a single likable or reliable to be found. The women were all victims-of themselves, of men, of each other. The men were all abusive and two out if three were openly misogynist. I was astonished to find the author was a woman - as the woman-hating tone started early and ran so deep. I suppose you could write it off to artistic license if the book were otherwise engaging, entertaining or thought-provoking - but it's not."
A good read.  I enjoyed it.
too redundant
"I absolutely hated this book.  It was a nightmare of self-analysis, insecurity, drunken blackouts, and soap opera drama.Ugh!  Save your money."
"My first time ever reading anything by this author I found the book to be very entertaining.I was a little confused in the beginning with the characters,but I kept reading and just enjoyed the book all the way to the end. The ending was a shocker didn't see that one coming. This book is a definitely must read put on your list..."
Great story..loved the characters.
A must read!
a thriller indeed!
Very suspenseful - with a twist!
Page turner!!
"This book is so good, the most interesting, most shocking, best book I've read in years! The story will grab you and won't let go!! Read it!!!!"
Great read!
"Creepy, but really good!"
A tad hard to follow but great read!
Very exciting
"Fast read, particularly at the beginning ."
It was thrilling!
"This book is often compared to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which was a much better book IMO. As I read this book I was often able to predict what would happen next, and the author's attempts to create suspense<U+200B> sometimes fell flat."
"The best thing about the book was that it did become very interesting in the last three chapters.  The most difficult part of the book was keeping the timeline and the characters straight. As a result, I had a difficult time finishing the book. Nevertheless, I try to finish a book club book so I can reasonably participate in the discussion. All of the characters are desperately flawed. It seems so unlikely to have so many dysfunctional people in one plot. If one is willing to suspend that disbelief, the outcome is, perhaps, less surprising. Therefore, I found it to be tedious even to the end. I am still surprised that the detectives, who had been so suspicious of everyone, were so willing to let the culprits go with only one standing up for the other. There was no reason for them to let them go without further investigation. Perhaps the story would take on a completely different aspect if told from the point of view from the detectives. As an English teacher, I would love to hear my students reconstruct the plot from the various points of view!  Fascinating idea!"
"An extremely well written book that I have found myself recommending to countless others. It is a real page turner that kept me guessing to the end. I thought it a really unusual and novel presentation of a psychological thriller; knowing the Victorian houses that line the railway tracks into London, I often found myself wondering about the people who lived behind their doors and windows . Writing the three main characters in the first person was an excellent idea allowing a more intimate knowledge of these women and none more so than the girl on the train herself. An unbelievably good, more than good, first novel, Paula Hawkins has a lot to live up to!"
"I put off buying this book because my husband always whines if I buy books written by women since he reads everything I buy and usually hates the 'female' point of view--.but this time--I read the book in an afternoon and evening and he decided to give it a try.  I thought maybe he'd hate it--it's first person ""female""...but he loved it--I totally lost him for the evening as he was engrossed from page one.The story is a sad one in many ways--especially if you or anyone close to you has an issue with addiction.  Simply reading the book can put you off alcohol for awhile.  The characters ring true--you ache for the main character and feel her confusion and fear.  I usually can figure out the 'who done it' by the time I'm a third of the way through most any mystery, but this one kept me guessing and even when I guessed right I didn't want to believe it.Fast paced--the kind of book you fall into and don't want to put down.  And--for all the men who fear women writers for their sentimentality--this is the perfect read."
"Like so many others have written in these reviews, I kept waiting for something momentous to happen.  Nothing.  It's just the stupidest story I can imagine. No wonder Hollywood has optioned it!  If you like reading about depressing alcoholics, stalkers, and ridiculous side characters, then this book is for you. No thank you. Yuck."
"I have about 75 more pages until I'm finished with this book. Yes, it's been dragging along for me and there are a few reasons:  1. The main characters lack real depth. I want to empathize or ""side"" with at least one of the characters but being unformed, they come across as one-dimensional and simply self-absorbed; 2. The book lacks suspense. The pace of the book is erratic because the author jumps back and forth in time for all of the main characters. These ""interruptions"" stall any suspense that should be building and growing and; 3. Like a STEREOTYPICAL day in London, the tone of the of the book is grey and gloomy which equated to dull for me.  I really wanted to like this book like the majority of reviewers and be able to tell friends and relatives, "" You really need to read this book!""  Not the case here.......but that's just my opinion."
"This is an engaging story of human frailties and trials. It is told in the first person, by different characters, which gives an extra layer of interest. There are no really ""good"" characters, but there is one very definitely ""bad"" one, and that identity remains a secret until almost the end. I read this book as part of a book club, and, as one of my fellow members put it, ""I didn't like any of the characters, but I loved thebook."" Couldn't agree more!"
"I like to read the really negative reviews, to see why someone hated a book I truly enjoyed.  The most consistent complaint is that none of the three main women characters were likeable, in fact, pretty much unlikeable.  I agree.  But so what.  You always have to have some likeable character?  Life is not like that.  If you need always someone likeable, stick to books written for teens.  Some had trouble following the plot.  It is not tricky at all, in fact, Ms. Hawkins is pretty ingenious in the way she plots this book.  A lot of books move backwards and forwards in time for seemingly no reason other than to be literary; this book has excellent reasons and it works.  Finally some claimed they figured out the (SPOILER ALERT) killer before coming close to being finished.  Baloney.  This is well-written, well-plotted, different and well done.  Sure if you think back on it some of it seems preposterous, but, there are very few mysteries in which that does not happen.  Congratulations Mr. Hawkins.  Well done.  Don't let the critical ducks nibble you to death."
"The storyline does a reasonable job of exploring the personalities of the characters, particularly the images in the imagination of ""The Girl On The Train"" in and of herself as she sees images from something of a distance, and frames illusions about what they mean. From my perspective this presents a tale of a person who really doesn't seem to know herself very well, replaces ""knowledge"" with suppositions, as well as other characters in the play, and as events unfold they grope through and eventually learn more about their foundations of themselves and among each other.Yes, there is some mystery that unfolds in a very slow way, and my guess is that we as readers actually know some people that have issues as told in the story that the characters will remind us of knowing. It is possible that some readers will ""see"" themselves in the tale. For those, that I'd guess would be in the minority, the work might trigger some inspiration although in and of itself I would not call this work inspirational nor would it qualify as dynamic: revealing; yes."
I didn't enjoy the start of this book and nearly put it down but because I didn't have anything else to read at the time I persevered and am glad I did. Whilst the whodunit side was fairly obvious by the third quarter of the book I was compelled to finish as I had finally found some empathy for the main character. I'm not sure I would bother reading one of her novels again but am not disappointed that I read this. The main issue for me was the dislikable main character who wasn't quite complex enough to be interesting either
Very thought provocative.
Great summer read!
I would recommend this book to people who like mysteriesMy husband is also reading the book  I love the detail that the novel goes into I enjoy reading  because books transform me to other places and help to inspire my imagination
Great
Boring
"I enjoyed it very much,"
Somewhat plodding though. Character development good. Enjoyed the British location. Should make a good basis for a movie. Going to remember the cork screw as weapon.
"So I needed to stop reading...when I clearly was so engrossed in these pages.  Loved the book, I don't read to try and figure out what's going to happen, in this case total shocker, I read to enjoy each page. Now I can watch the movie with clear expectations.  I recommend for a quick read"
"I can't believe people actually like this!  This is boring, predictable, and just plain stupid.  There are basically a handful of events that just repeat itself until the writer decides it's enough.  The characters are boring and not likable.  The plot is repetitive.  They are all one dimensional.  I had 5th grade students who write like this.  There is no suspense."
"Better than the movie and takes place in London.  make sure you pay attention to which character is ""speaking"" in each chapter or you'll get confused."
"Took me a while to adapt to the writer's style, but the story kept me going and I soon got accustomed to the very ""British"" style (and the somewhat anaccronistic setting as the story developed). No wonder it was adapted into a blockbuster motion picture!!"
"Not my usual genre (I am a historical fiction, nonfiction, period piece kind of gal) and I normally shy away from best sellers. Read only because a coworker said it was better than ""Gone Girl"" (which I did not care for at all) and my mom kept asking if I knew what all the hubbub was about this book. A few pages into it I was totally hooked and couldn't put it down (laundry didn't get done and the b.f barely got supper). I HAD to find out whodunit. A little predictable (I figured it out about halfway through) but still an engaging read through to the end. Definitely had a Hitchcock vibe and would make a great movie! My mom, also an avid reader, was a little more lukewarm about it. She thought it was okay, but definitely not her style (she is a romance/historical fiction/Nora Roberts fan). We both were entertained and decided in the end it was money well spent (but then when is money spent on a book not well spent)."
"Okay, let me first admit that I am not a fan of 'psychological' novels, and had I known this was one, I wouldn't have bought it.  Nor am I happy with authors who use something like psychology and/or addiction to get the character to do something totally brain-dead.  This author used both.  This is one of those stories that would be an essay if the heroine just used some common sense (just a teeny bit of common sense!) in the first chapter.  In addition, I didn't like a single character in the book and was severely tempted to stop reading it, but I knew I wanted to write a review, so I must read the whole thing.  The character closest to likable was Cathy, who was super-nice and a major enabler of Rachel's psychological and addiction problems--basically a doormat and doing all the wrong things."
"A caution I neglected to heed was all of the comments comparing this book to Gone Girl, another book I really did not like. Instead I looked at all of the reviews raving about the book and plunked my money down. Unless you enjoy muddled mysteries with unlikeable people and can totally suspend logic, steer clear!"
"Great book! Fast read, brilliantly written. The suspense was awesome. Never knowing until the end who the actual killer was.  Rachel on the verge of the end but hanging in there trying her best to pull it together in order to help those characters who had become her only life after her divorce. And Cathy for not giving up on Rachel, not approving but never really letting her go. The ties that binds real friends and caring people. In a time when it's easier to look the other way. Once again overall it was an awesome book. Will definitely recommend to all my friends and family. Thank you Paula for writing this book."
The plot is thin and all problems are solved when the main character's blackout memory gap suddenly resolves itself . . . despite the author's repeated warnings throughout the book that this is not how blackouts work. But it doesn't matter. By the end you don't care who dies or who survives because the characters are so ridiculously unlikable. Spoiler alert: Don't bother pushing through to the end under the assumption that it has to get better. It does not.
This is from one who has read some and drunk some more and I would say the main focus in this book is on the alcohol addiction and how that befuddles you and less on the actual crime. Good  insight in the alcohol department and other potential addictions.  I would have loved to see how Rachel would manage to get sober with good support  and get her life back and then solve the crime in question.
"I read this book in ONE weekend...and I have a toddler.  It is the definition of a page turner.  It is told from 3 sets of views.  Rachel is the main character.  She is a young woman living a life of lies.  Her alcoholism cost her marriage, job and dream life.  To keep up appearances, she rides the train to the job she no longer holds.  She takes this opportunity to watch the house her ex husband and new wife live in.  She also becomes obsessed with the neighbors, Jess, a few houses down.  She make believes a life for them and creates a story surrounding the beautiful woman and her husband.  Her obsessive nature leads to several run ins with her ex husband and his new wife and former mistress, Anna.  After an alcohol filled night she discovers Jess is missing and she has no  recollection of the night.  All she knows is that she was on that street and had an altercation with Anna.  It is a gripping page turner and about the time you think you have it figured out... guess again!"
"I wonder if I was the only person who hoped that Rachel would also at some point, be murdered. She was almost unbearably pathetic and unfortunately without any other strong, likable characters I just found myself whipping through the book so I didn't have to be reading it anymore."
"I downloaded a sample of this book on my Kindle.  When I finished the sample I chose not to purchase it at that time and maybe read it later. What I had read in the sample was slow, depressing and just not of much interest to me.  After having several people tell me they liked it, I purchased it.  I'm glad I read the  entire book, but it took over 1/2 way through for me to look forward to picking it up and reading it.  The girl is an alcoholic, which is depressing enough, but she rides this train everyday and noses into other peoples lives who live in houses along the train tracks by watching them as she rides by.  Although all of those things she witnessed during her train rides tie into the story later on in the book, it was depressing and boring to me at first.  At the point where I started to see how it all tied together, the book got quite interesting and I'm glad I stayed with it.  Had me guessing to the end about what really took place.  Glad my friends pushed me to read the book.  It was worth it."
"I found it difficult to get into the book.  After reading the first fifty pages, I had a hard time picking it back up to read.I was on an airplane with time to kill which is why I finished the book.The first half of the book rambled and was hard to relate to the characters.  The last third of the book was more interesting,but I'm not sure if it was worth the pain and boredom to get there.  The story line dragged on and on.  But, her characterdevelopment was pretty good.  Towards the end of the book, I began to gain more understanding/sympathy of Rebecca,Megan, Tom, and other characters.  The author's writing style was average to me in comparison to, what I think, are better writers,e.g., Patrick Smith, Nelson DeMille, Pat Conroy, et. al.Bottom line, maybe the book is a better read for those more sensitive and emotional than me."
"The first few pages pulled me in; the way the characters or at least the central female characters each got a turn to ""talk"".  I connected with them even if I would not want to be their friend.  The personality of many of these characters frustrated me to no end as one is an alcoholic - and all are self-involved - but then I would imagine the portrayal of the alcoholic was true-to-life.  I know it is with the self-involved individuals.It was interesting to see how deeply you can be involved in someone’s life without actually knowing that person.  It speaks to our voyeur society and the interconnection of events through our life.The end was not predictable although someone might argue that it was wrapped up a bit too smoothly.  I still had questions at the end – so everything was not answered to my satisfaction.Regardless, it was never boring and the pace is fast.  I would like to have another book this minute that would entertain me as this one did."
"I came close to dumping this book after about 4 chapters...it is a slow-burn.  I really disliked where I thought it was going. But, since it was on the Best Seller List, I thought there just had to be more to it. I was so pleasantly surprised at how this book developed.  It was really, really good!  I hope this author can write more books that are this full of surprises!"
"The girl on the train is Rachel.  When the train stops at the signals, Rachel follows the movements of the couple who live at 11 Blenheim Road.  In her imagination they are Jess and Jason. In fact they are Scott and Megan.  A few doors down that road live Tom, Rachel's ex-husband, and his new wife, Anna. Rachel imagines a blissfully in love couple and is shocked when she sees another man in the back yard with Megan in an intimate embrace. Then there is the news that Megan is missing.  Rachel feels compels to assist the police.  And so the complex investigation begins.  However, underlying the whole story is Rachel's alcoholism and her propensity to invent things (tell lies).  The narration is shared between Rachel, Megan and Anna.  Rachel tries to fight her alcoholism and this has a poignant insight into the struggle of an addict to try to kick the habit – with always an excuse to procrastinate – “I'll start tomorrow”.  It always bothers me when the author chooses to tell the murder in the victim's voice.  The underlying theme of the book, one could say, is “truth or lies”."
"As much as the book was interesting, I have to say I just really didn't like it."
"Interesting book that puts you in the mind of Gone Girl, but this book is not as well written. Even though I pretty much read it in one sitting, it bogged down about 40% in - I couldn't see where it was going which you would think is a good thing, but there was just too much drunk Rachel.  I got kinda tired of reading it, but I rarely start a book and not finish it.  Besides, it picked back up after a major discovery and that made it easier to finish.  I read this because my sister read it first and wanted me to as well before we see the movie.  It's likely this will be one of the few movies that are better than the book it's based on.  3.5 stars"
"I will be honest the book was amazing. It pulled you in to the lives of everyone in the book. You felt there anger, pain, and confusion. You trusted and you were betrayed. You somehow become part of the book trying to figure out who killed Megan. It kept you captured with sleepless nights. Until the end. Sadly the ending left unsatisfied. It didn't quench my thirst on how the characters were left off. It just left you hanging, hoping for more but sadly nlothing else will come. I wished the author ended it without the cliffhanger, in my opinion. But all in all the book was great but ending sucked. So I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5."
"I'm bedridden after surgery so just finished reading Girl on the Train to pass the time.What I liked: the plot. I found it an unusual writing style to tackle the story from a commuter's perspective.What I didn't like: not one single character. For me, I don't have to fall in love with a character (I certainly didn't with Gone Girl and I loved that book). But Rachel, the main character was thin, underdeveloped, shallow, weak, self-pitying and a drunk. The book is told by three characters, Rachel being the main one. Anna is married to Rachel's ex-husband, whom Rachel still pines for. Anna is vapid, self-centered and flat out annoying. Megan (who is first known as Jess in Rachel's fairy-tail version of people she views from the train window) is mentally unstable with a sordid past.I figured out the ending about two thirds through. This was disappointing because I like to be utterly shocked by a book's ending. It's not the worst book I've read, but certainly not the best. It'll do."
"Very clever concept. I couldn't put it down and read it in four hours straight through, finishing up at 2 am. Rachel is a mess, but that adds to the suspense and I think a lot of women who've ever been cheated on could identify with her, and with most of the female characters at least on some level, no matter how dark and messed up they can be. Overall, I thought it was well worth my time and money and I'd read it again."
"A depressed girl lives in a fantasyland, refuses to move on, rides the train everyday, pretends to work, creates a life for some people she sees who lived by her old house. She gets so drunk all the time she has blackout moments. The girl she created a life for goes missing. She inserts herself into the investigation because she has nothing else to do. The whole book goes back and forth between what happened, I'm scared, she acts completely paranoid, and round and round we go. I just wanted the book to get on with it!!  Seriously how many times can we stand to listen to her internal monologue?  Not to mention this book is extremely depressing. Author needs an editor. I got tired of the same drivel that didn't seem to move the story along. And don't even get me started on how pathetic every single woman was portrayed in this book. I think the idea was good but way to slow paced for me."
"What I loved about the book was the concept. How many times have you driven past the same houses, same people, and imagined what their lives would be like? The story begins as a daily commuter, Rachael, who struggles with alcoholism, watches a loving couple from the train...(Jess and Jessie) she's chosen them, their house, because it is directly down the street from her ex-husband and his new wife - the woman he left her for....The storyteller has created quite a loving life for this mystery couple; an artist and a doctor!! Then one day, from her seat on the train, Rachel  witnesses what she believes to be adultery...Cursed with drunken blackout's, curiosity and just bad luck, Rachel awakes one morning, covered in blood, wounds on her body, with no recollection of how she got in this predicament...Rachel finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation...and possibly intimate with the murderer. Interesting, quick read."
"Paula Hawkins knows how to write a good book.  She knows how important it is to produce sentences and paragraphs  to keep the reader turning pages and in this book, the reader must read to the very end of the novel to find our 'Who Done It?""  In this day and time where grammar and punctuation is hardly taught in American high school English Classes, Paula clearly know when to use a comma, colon, or semi-colon.  I find this refreshing that there are writers out there who know how to use these tools.  Sometimes I think editors do not know how to write sentences, use correct punctuation, use the correct tense of a verb and other tools that make reading such a pleasure for one and all."
"I just couldn't get into this book at all.  I've picked it up multiple times, and just couldn't do it.  Part of it is the pitiful state of the woman - you could see her total inability to cope right off the bat - but the author beat it to death setting you up to realize she was not going to end up being a credible person when it really mattered.  Frankly I gave up - possibly too early - I suppose eventually she figures out the whole thing and is able to convince the authorities that she really has a clue - BUT I just couldn't bring myself to get to that point.  Bravo for those who were able to finish this book and  thinks it's terrific - I'm not one of them."
"Ms Hawkins has a problem here, but one that the publishers are happy to exploit - Gone Girl.There were always going to be comparisons, but the marketing opportunity was enormous, and it was taken advantage of. In fact, one has to wonder, ""What was the original title of the manuscript?""Standing on its own feet, it's not a bad read. Not the page turner various reviews had me expecting, it plodded along in sections, and wasn't helped by the stilted writing. Trains trundle more than once, sunlight is burnished, knuckles white on wheels... we've all read it more than once.  Given the structure, more adept character development was called for, along with stronger, more distinct voices. It was difficult to invest too much in the main character, and the men came across more as projections than flesh and blood.Having said all that, it would make for a decent read on the train to and from work.Probably safer than looking out the window, in Ms Hawkins' world."
"Everyone was talking about “The Girl on the train”. So I hopped on the bandwagon or should I say I hopped on the train too and bought the hard cover, not even the paperback. It seemed interesting about this girl who keeps admiring this couple she sees every day from her train window. It all fell flat…a psychological thriller it should be…I would psychological garbage…. The writer in my view is psychotic…..a lousy story with too much. She kept blacking out and can’t remember anything…too often…really makes no sense.I waste to buy the book and a waste of time on it…writer was just as drunk as Rachel in the story!"
"Don't be lulled into a false sense of security. Like the slow click of roller coaster wheels climbing up their first steep incline, this book starts slowly, lost in the mind of one woman whose tragic life is submerged in the blurring haze of alcohol where fantasy becomes easily confused with reality and self-pity comes as easily and frequently as fear and doubt. Then, just when the reader is beginning to feel this book might be moving just a little too slow to be worth finishing, the coaster reaches its peak. What follows is a hurtling descent full of twists and turns that will leave you gripping, white knuckled, into the wee hours of the morning."
"Not sure what all the fuss is about. It was a good read but not a great read. No one is a good person in this story or who they seem to be on the surface. Except maybe the long suffering roommate. Rachel is in a downward spiral and we are forced to go on the ride. She spots a young couple from her train she takes every day into work. She makes up a life for them, names them and projects her hopes or dashed hopes as it were upon them. Then she finds they are not who she thinks they are. Only they live a few doors down from Rachel's ex and new wife and baby. When the women she has seen from the train goes missing, she can't help but interject herself into the investigation. Rachel thinks she has a clue as to who might have taken her. Only she is a drunk and can't remember what happened that night. Was she there? Takes awhile to find out and when you do, your not too surprised."
"Okay, I can understand how this got to be a best seller. Kudos to Paula Hawkins for writing a hell of good debut novel. I expect to see more from her, though I wouldn't say I'm looking forward to it. The mystery unfolds slowly here but the plot's well crafted, not predictable, tedious or boring. While I was starting to figure it out before the author revealed it, the story was still far more suspenseful than most mysteries. Hawkins is also a very good wordsmith. So why only three stars? Frankly, I found the characters, complex and as well developed as they are, to be just plain depressing. Many reviewers describe the main character, and sometimes a few of the others, as ""unreliable."" I found the book to be full of unpleasant people. Not the kind of people I wanted to spend much time with. No fun at all, so because of the grim people, I'm giving it a grim three stars. Sorry..."
"Good read, it was difficult to put down. The early part of the book was mostly informational, introducing and defining the 3 main characters. I thought  all 3 were similar in some aspects and had to go back and recall which character I was reading about. This by no means took away from the enjoyment. As I continued to read, the characters became more defined and I could see them as different individuals with some similarities. The longer I read, the harder it became to put down.  Wasn't expecting the ending, but then, isn't that the point of being a good writer!  I am lookig forward to seeing the movie based on this book, it should be intereting!"
"Well, I read this book in two days, and was sad when I finished.  Not what I expected, but better.  The characters are well developed, but with lots of unexpected twists.  Just when you think you've got a handle on things, you realize you don't!  Not a book to pick up if you don't have time to really jump into it.  The movie is coming out soon, and I'm not sure how I feel about seeing it.  Usually, if its a really good book, I am typically disappointed by the film.  I think I'll see it, though,  just because I enjoyed the plot so much, and Emily Blunt is in it.  I am going to be looking forward to Paula Hawkins next book for sure!  GREAT read!"
I do not understand the hype about this book at all.. It was boring and drawn out and I only kept reading it so I could finally find out what happened. And it wasn't even anything crazy or twisted. I won't spoil it for anyone but be prepared to read a bunch of blah blah blah for the first 80% of the book and the blah blah blah didn't need to be said because it didn't make the end better. There was no omg moment. For me anyway. Thats what I was hoping for. And I didn't get it in this book
"This is a fun read to do with someone else especially since you can then see the movie and discuss. We both got confused with character and time changes, that caused us to have to pause and review a few times. While some revelations were predictable the collateral damage of the most volatile characters was not always. If you have read the book I wouldn't necessarily say you need to see the movie (unless like me, you were curious to experience another point of view,) however, if you have only seen the movie DO get the book-reading the thoughts of the characters versus watching them - totally different journey"
Took some time to untangle characters and story line but was a good read.
"I'm not one to post warnings for books and usually think people old enough to buy adult fiction should be capable of separating fact and fantasy, but this book- wow.. The hype about this novel is everywhere and so many reviewers rave about it,  so- to be honest- I purchased it without really knowing much more than it was about a missing woman, told through the narrative of a woman on the train. This is entirely my responsibility, but this book is hard to read.It is a page turner, to be sure.  I read it over the course of a few days, staying up far later than I should have, and sneaking pages wherever I could. I didn't particularly like it though- there are no sympathetic characters, and I felt vaguely sick each time I read.  I should've seen where it was going before I did.  I guessed early on who the ""bad-guy"" was, but didn't anticipate the level of psychologically terrifying domestic abuse and gas-lighting the author has the men in this novel heap on the 3 female narrators."
"I started this book quite a while ago and put it down bc the many characters' narratives were confusing and I got tired of trying to keep them straight. When the movie was announced I decided to give it another try. Once I decided to pay more careful attention to the change in voices and got to know the characters better, I got sucked in so strongly that I couldn't put it down! Another family member had the same experience! Now I'm delighted I gave it a second chance. I must admit to have guessed at the culprit about half way through, but the way that was revealed was terrific. And now I can't wait to see what they do to the story in the movie."
"I would not of probably chosen this book but it was given to me in an odd circumstance & I felt compelled to read it. I really enjoyed the way it was written as passages from 3 different woman's views, women, who given a different chance at meeting would of probably been friends.Unfortunately, this is not an option and the book leads you down a path between understanding each woman's motivation for their actions, whilst giving you a unique insight into their choices.The ending is worth the read and you may, as I did equally like the three main characters or have a different opinion. Either way, I recommend this book & if I could share with you the ironic way this book came into my hands, you would probably laugh and understand why I enjoyed out so much."
The book has a good start.  But 3/4 of the way into the book I knew where it was headed. The ending was so/so
"Truly, I did not find the main character a very likeable person. Her choices in life behaviors were abhorrent to me.  Not a main character I would like to read about, to get all into her drunken thought processes and behaviors as the book digs deeper.  But, I couldn't extricate myself out of the twists of the story, actually looking forward to the 'alternate person' storylines for something tangible.  While the mystery and writing kept me interested in turning the page (or in my case, the Kindle) and all the elements came together with satisfying answers....I was just left empty, with no real compassion for any of them.  I remember many other books where I find the character(s) so moving in one way or another that I miss them as friends, but when I finished this book, all I felt was relief....so glad I wasn't part of that community or their lives."
"I was expecting an exciting novel, but was rather disappointed. All the characters are unbearably uninteresting and, frankly, quite pathetic. The first two thirds of the book are spent detailing the excruciatingly mundane failures of our protagonists, aching for something, anything, interesting to happen.The pace picks up a the end, however the grand reveal is so predictable you lose interest in the story well before the characters become aware of what is going on.The writing is decent, but overall I would not recommend this. There are lots of better novels out there to choose from.Stay away from this one."
The three main female characters were all equally too neurotic. No depth to the characters to distinguish one woman from another. One drank (too much for her to do the actions described in the book) - one haunted by a tragedy but was more interested in controlling men through sex and the other just wanted a house away from the trains. Really? The men - both violent. These typical stereotypes of women and men bring the book down. And the red haired guy on the train- no development on him. He shows up - tells a version of the events and moves on. I would have like to learn more about the two detectives that did the investigation. They needed some personality/personal history not just facial expressions.The story line is very good. I finished the book because I wanted to see how it turned out. But reading the dialogue of those whiny women - was annoying and made the book less interesting. I did learn a few new British terms - thanks for that.
"Terrible book, couldn't finish it!"
Definitely would read again so twisted! Kept me turning the pages wanting more. I couldn't get to the killer quick enough
I could just never get into it.
good book. i read it fast
This book is a real page turner. But the ending is disappointing. I would still recommend it though if you are looking for something quick and easy to read.
Loved this book!
"An amazing, well wrote thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller. Well worth the read!"
Ending a little bit unbelievable.  Otherwise suspenseful.  Great character development.  Can't wait to see how movie develops plot and suspense
Great read! Couldn't put it down! So glad I read it before I saw the movie. Definitely recommend reading this one.
Book is awesome!
"Rachel is “the girl on the train”.  She spends her days riding to and from London, usually well on her way to drunken oblivion, in an attempt to keep her roommate from realizing she’s been sacked from her job.  As she rides the train, sipping canned gin and tonics, she becomes obsessed with “Jess and Jason”, a couple whose house backs the tracks.  In her mind, she imagines the happy life they lead based on the glimpses she gets as the train trundles past.  At least until she sees Jess kissing another man on her deck.  When Jess goes missing the very next day, Rachel's reality begins to get significantly more complicated.Hawkins does a fantastic job of taking the facts and tearing them to shreds.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, you turn the page and poof, your theory implodes.  This is a page-turner that is packed with twists and turns you never see coming.  This is not a beach-read, however.  Make sure you have time to invest if you plan to see it through."
"I hesitated to buy this book due to the recent rash of negative critiques. Don't consider them, this book is a tremendously gripping, suspense filled take on a ""who-done-it"" style of mystery. I read it in 3 days. It flowed well, and the first person style of narration didn't throw me like some books do. I love a character like Rachel, the girl on the train... flawed, yet intriguing. She is like a modern day Bridget Jones in many ways, and the self-effacing manner in which she interacts with the others in her life is both disturbing and endearing. I didn't expect to be so drawn in by this book, so I was pleasantly surprised. American readers should know there is a fair amount of British wording and spelling, (""plaster"" is a band-aid, for example), but this didn't bug me. I would definitely recommend this book if you want to read something that you will enjoy, and something that might just keep you up reading until after 2 a.m.!"
"I have to admit that I hate books where the MC is a self loathing mess. While I have that out of the way, The Girl on the Train is an interesting read. She takes the story of a pathetic train rider, trying to hide the fact that she lost her job, and weaves it in with the stories of others living nearby. While there is a heroine of sorts, you can't help but shake your head at this collection of warped souls. No one is innocent and everyone has some sort of secret to hide. Although I suspect Paula Hawkins is being a little overly harsh on the human condition, but it is her book to write.It does get a little confusing in some dialogue points where I lost track of who was saying what to whom, but those points were few and far between. The flow was steady and the characters were sufficiently well developed that you felt for them and loathed them at the same time.Overall, a good book. I liked reading it and ultimately felt like it was worth my time and money."
"I was a little slow on the uptake realizing there were three different characters telling their stories. Once I got a clue I followed the story line better. The three stories are dated on each of their chapters, but unless you are compulsive about noting the dates, it's a little hard to follow where you are in the action in terms of the time line. Ultimately it comes together and the time line becomes less important.Altogether though, I think it was a well constructed story, interesting to follow. The most interesting character was struggling with alcoholism and I believe the portrayal by the author was very on target and fascinating to follow.Aspects of it make it not-such-an-easy read, but it certainly makes you think, and that's ok too.Generally well done - I would read another by this author."
"Really a 2.5 start review.One dimensional characters who, for the most part, I felt no empathy or care for. I understand that sometimes there are flawed characters that are DISTINCTLY flawed but I just really didn't find myself caring for the trio of leading females or their male counterparts. What I did like is the mystery and suspense in this one. While it is a big of a plodding story there were just (and barely that) enough hooks sprinkled into the story to keep me reading a little more otherwise I would have put this down and never picked it back up. In sum though a solid mystery it is really just a middling read with sub par damaged female leads."
"The Girl on the Train should not be read on my Kindle.  The chapter headings, providing an orientation to who is narrating and when, are indispensable to following the book, and in my case the essential information was illegible--or maybe I didn't pay attention, until  it was too late.  Also, don't attempt to read this book in fits and starts.  It will be frustrating to figure out who's narrating and when.  There are several narrators, and at least one is unreliable.  None are interesting.I wish writers would notice that drug and alcohol problems have already been written about very comprehensively.  I really am sick of the vomit on the carpet genre.  This books devotes way too much to attention to describing the perils of drinking.I guess the structure and characters are meant to create suspense and mystery, but I found instead confusion and tediousness."
"This book really annoyed me, yet I couldn't stop reading it. The suspense is what kept me going but I really didn't like any of the characters. It's written from the perspectives of Rachel, Megan and Anna and most of it is Rachel, ""the girl on the train"". Rachel is a drunk and I've never dealt with drunk people in real life but just reading about her drunkenness and blackouts exhausted me. This taught me to never read another book if drinking plays any part of the story. When I read mysteries I like to guess all along and try and put the clues together. The problem with this story (without giving things away) is that, the end is not what you expect, simply because the author didn't want you guessing, therefore, the storyline of certain characters completely changes to make sense of it all... When all along, that's not what you were told. I gave the book 4 stars just because it kept me interested, which is hard to do if I don't like ANY of the characters.... I finished the book feeling irritated."
"I read the book through and therefore will give it two 1/2 stars.Other than that, with all the publicity hype, I was surprised and disappointed at the quality of the writing, the interminable diary-like entries with the same literary voice, and the tiresome first person present throughout.That the characters are not admirable or don’t experience any semblance of personal growth by the end of the story is not necessarily a criticism. Although I do think some kind of moral reflection makes for a stronger and more memorable protagonist. It’s okay to have the dregs of humanity populate your story, but in this one, they move through it like a bunch of snakes in a pit – not thinking beyond their most primal impulses.I give the writer credit for keeping me reading, having created a certain amount of tension and suspense.  But then I take it back for letting me down in the end.  I wanted to care about Rachel, Anna and Megan but in the end all I wanted to do was be rid of them and their tedious soliloquies."
"The novel is written with the interesting strategy of moving from the mind of one woman to another of the three whose lives are intertwined in unfortunate ways.  I was confused by that at first and couldn't get a sense of what was going on or how I was supposed to interpret this.  But in time, the connection of each to the others began to gel and then I was in.  The characters are interesting and dark in different ways and the actions of each has affected the lives of the other two in devastating ways although none of them knows the others very well.  The suspense grows toward the end as you begin to realize that you're finally going to find out just who did what and the climax was riveting.  I wouldn't have recommend it while reading the first several chapters but I hung with it and I'm glad I did.  Worth reading and the story continues to haunt me a little bit days later after finishing it."
"I actually bought this book back last year. I tried to read it a couple of times but just couldn't get into it. Well now that they've made a movie out of it I figured I needed to try again. So, I plunged in. I've read other books like this one where it's really a slow moving book, they just don't keep my attention. I'm giving it three stars just because others must have seen something good in it in order to make a movie from it. Even though I finished it I'm sorry but I just wouldn't recommend reading it. I know there are others that I'm sure loved it, but I love murder mysteries and this one is just too slow moving for me."
"Since the novel was proclaimed as the next Gone Girl, I was eager to get started since I loved that book. Rather than a real psychological thriller, it turned out to be a regular who dun it..not the type of literature that I typically enjoy.Although there was an interesting mix of women, all who were suffering in some way because of motherhood, some of the sections seemed to drag on and on.As the author portrayed the alcoholic binges of the main character, I believe that she wanted us, too, caught in the downward spiral.  That worked the first one of two times around, but then became a drudge to read.If the who dun it genre is your reading style, you will probably enjoy it.  For me, it was just okay."
"Omgosh--definitely the page-turner. An hour on gym treadmill literally flew by while reading this book. Really exciting psychothriller type story, with multiple POVs... can't wait to see the feature film. Apparently actress Rebecca Ferguson of the awesome new Mission Impossible is going to star, alongside the very talented actress Emily Blunt. This book really isn't like Gone Girl, per se, except in the sense that someone is murdered and it is a thrilling fiction read... as this book is quite mysterious until near the end (with GG, you know pretty quick that the wife is a crazy-arse beeyatch who is framing her hubbers) as you don't really know who did the deed. Also, this story is a full-on ensemble piece. Omgosh, know that I'm gushing but this is a book to re-read and can't wait to see the film. Hope the author writes more thrillers, will definitely read. Happy reading~*"
"I'd heard so much upbeat comments about Girl On The Train, that I had to try it.  I'd ridden on trains in England 12 years ago and enjoyed it immensely watching the countryside and seeing the backs of little houses and their yards. I can see the pull of this context of a disturbed and very hurt girl losing herself in the same views from the train day by day.  In some ways it was a very intriguing story, but for me there has to be at least one character I want to pull for....cheer on...see him or her through to the end.  In this book there were no such characters that I latched onto and committed to and worried about. Every character in this story was someone to worry about...and many had very dark undercurrents pulling and pushing them to sordid doings.  So, yes, I did finish it and gladly put it down.  It was not uplifting, but if you like dark, sad, depressing mysteries then this is your cup of tea. Everyone to his own taste. See Gee"
"I am not going to bother to run a synopsis of the book, you can already see that in the description in the listing.  I am so enjoying this book and I am only through the first 80 pages or so.  I am actually reading a bit at a time because I want it to last, LOL  The characters as well as, the plot-line, are very well written.  I was drawn into the story and involved by the first few pages.  For me, that is the hallmark of a very, very good read.You become the characters, you live their lives, feel for them, dislike them, and cheer then on.  Also, as a Brit, the authors  description of all things British are spot on!"
"For me this was a GREAT read.  I enjoyed every moment of life within the lives of its characters.  The author reveals events, feelings and interchanges of the characters at a steady pace holding my attention and wanting to read on.  Chapter lengths were the same way. I related to the main character as I have had a drinking problem and experiences many of the same feelings and decisions as she did.  I hope I can now enjoy the movie more from reading the novel and if  it  dose not compare positively I will enjoy thinking about the differences and relive the pleaseant experience of  reading the book."
"A sad joke concerning those who are substance abusers asks ""How can you tell an addict is lying?"" Answer: ""His/her lips are moving."" Really not funny, but it supports a basic tenet of this book: every character is a liar. Most of the story is told from the point of view of a severe alcoholic, who looks into the homes of people whose houses are near the railroad tracks of the train she is on. She invents stories about their lives in between her drunken stupors. One day a murder occurs involving one of the people she watches; she decides to try to solve the murder on her own after lying to the police, making up her own story of what she believes happens. No spoiler alert here about what happens and who's involved. Suffice to say, the title of the book is a bit misleading: when I saw ""girl"", I thought the book would feature a young girl and her adventures on a train as it crosses the English countryside. Reading about a whino whose husband dumped her is not my cup of tea."
"I was fairly entertained by this book. Nice twist at the end. Got a little long in the middle with the unreliable narrator, Rachel, and her going on and on about the same things. Anna and Megan were just annoying sometimes. My basic problem with this book is the lack of someone to really root for. I had the same problem with Gone Girl. I didn't like any of the characters enough to truly feel invested in them. Although I liked the 'just desserts' for one of the baddies in the end. That was satisfying. I liked this book well enough to keep reading. Maybe I was a bit underwhelmed because I expected more with all the hype about it. I'd give it 3.5 stars."
"""The Girl on the Train"" definitely had it's ups and downs. The main character - an alcoholic spending half the book in a drunken stupor - was infuriating, frustrating, and downright depressing. There were times where I felt truly sad for her, and others where I rolled my eyes at her terrible decision making. There are only a few characters in this novel at all, and none of them are likable. The plot had a lot of promise, though the end was more of an over-dramatized Lifetime movie and less ""Gone Girl"". It was a fun read, but nothing that shines in terms of mind-blowing twists and turns or characterization."
"I have heard the characters were all mental cases - yep to some degree they were.  A girl with a vivid imagination watched homes and the people who lived there from the train every day. Imagining their lives as stable, peaceful, loving, she couldn't have been further from the truth.  As an alcoholic, the girl became a different person when she drank too much, became involved in the lives of the people she watched from the train and almost lost her life because of that.  The surprise ending was handled very well by the author. I have a lot of responsibilities, so I am not one to read a book through at one sitting; therefore when I would have to take care of duties, my mind was constantly on the book, wondering, wondering - what next!  Good book and it would have been a real page turner if I had the ability to do that.  Really loved the way it was put together, with chapters on the main female characters. Really enlightened the understanding!"
"I liked the story although it took a while for me to get interested.  I am not a fan of the journal type of writing.  I did not care for it in Gone Girl, and I prefer a story that is written in the first person.  However, that being said, I'm not sure how the suthor could have written this novel in any other fashion than the way she did.  I alternated feeling angry and sympathetic to Rachel.  She was her own worst enemy.  She did so many things without thinking through what the ramifications of her actions might be.  You just wanted to shake her to wake her up.  I am very interested in seeing how the movie handles the characters of this novel."
"Read this book in a day! It's a true page-turner. Similar to Gone Girl, but BETTER! Way better! Highly recommend!"
Thrilling and interesting. Grwat read
Held my interest.
"Based on the reviews of The Girl on the Train, I was anticipating a well written psychologically sound thriller. Right up my alley. But no, it was a dead end. I found the dialogue tedious. The plot lacked intricacy. The women - Rachel, Anna and Megan - were drunk, depressed and disappointed while the men lacked credibility. I read the whole book. I've never before written a book review but have read and depended on many, so I felt I owed to potential readers to share my negative opinion."
Great read!! Better than Gone Girl. Can't wait for Paula Hawkins next book.
"I have trouble staying interested in a lot of books, but this one definitely held my attention. I highly recommend it!"
I need this book for this weekend ?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!! ThaT'S WHY I PAY EXTRA DAMN??!?!??!?!??!?!
they werre all different
One of the stupidest books I've ever read - not sure why this author even bothered -
This book is a real thriller. It has a slow start and quickly became a page-turner. Definitely recommend!
"I've heard so much about this book and was excited to give it a read, but was seriously disappointed once I read it. The ending was easily predictable and it started out very slow. However, I ended up reading the entire thing to make sure I wasn't missing anything and to say that I read it. I personally wouldn't recommend it, but I know others who really enjoyed the book."
"I loved this book, and couldn't put my Kindle down while I was reading it. I thought the approach was fresh, and for me at least, not predictable.  I liked the author's style in releasing information a bit at a time rather than revealing everything all at once.  I had heard so much about the film that it made me curious about the book, so I decided to read it before I saw the movie.  I still haven't seen it, and heard it's not as good as the book, but I think few films ever are.  This is not the type of book I'm usually attracted to, but I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience."
"I was sooo excited to read this book after all of the great things I heard about it.  It took me a couple of tries before I was in the right frame of mind to read it.  For me, there was too much of the book wrapped up in how drunk and miserable she was.  This part got old fast and made the story drag on.  I guessed who the villain was way before the end of the book.  I think I would have liked it more if the main character, Rachel, would have made more attempts to improve herself throughout the story, even as she was embroiled in her obsession.  Her pathetic nature just kind of overshadowed the whole book for me."
"My curiosity was piqued by this novel upon seeing it at the bestseller list for quite a while, at the same time I was quite skeptic as to how this could be such a bestseller.With the first few pages I was drawn to Rachel's life and how during her daily train travel to and from her new home she would watch her previous home and her past wonderful life at the same time admiring the couple three houses down. She has in her mind that they are happy - Jess and Jason was what she named them. Then suddenly things are not what they are.I loved the switching of point of views. At the same I wanted to shake Rachel to tell her to stop drinking, stop with those bloody black outs, I wanted to know what she saw/remembered. The Girl On A Train is engrossing and will keep you guessing. I did not see it coming and at the same time toward the end of the book, I was like - why is my least favorite character involved...what...and then I went oh...I get it now."
Too slow. It requires a lot of patience. Style of writing makes it further boring . Could have used direct method of story telling and should have made it a thriller easily. Though story line is good and convincing yet does not make an absorbing reading.
"This book is terrific from 1st page to the last!!! The characters are so well developed, and the author switches from one to the other very smoothly. The main character is a woman named Rachel, and it is she who rides the train everyday, giving the reader a bird's eye view of what she sees, and what she imagines about the people that she sees everyday. Her imagination takes over reality, but we soon find out that the real lives of these people are much worse than what she imagined for them. We also get to know Rachel, and all about her sad battle with alcohol, and also her ex-husband and his new wife, who are prominent characters in the book. The book is never boring, and these people are so interesting, and so complex, that you just feel compelled to keep reading. It is definitely thrilling, and the moodiness of the grey weather in England is the perfect background for the story."
"Wonderful British murder mystery but more than that, the protag is a drunk, something we don't see much in novels. She is struggling with alcoholism and her credibility is compromised. I loved this twist.TGOTT is a murder mystery that takes place in the suburbs of London England. A woman who's been replaced by her husband (in his life and their house) notices the neighbors from the train and becomes engrossed in their affairs. It's a case of voyeurism and more.The novel is written beautifully, flawlessly. The mystery is compelling with the author feeding us just the right amount of information about each character to let us think they could've been the killer. Well done."
"The Girl On The Train is a well-crafted, suspense novel told from the perspective of three very different women.  It is full of plot twists and turns and unpredictable until the very end.  Although the storyline is quite depressing, the well-developed characterizations of Rachel, Megan and Anna are realistic enough to elicit sympathy and caring concern.  The women are all flawed, as are the male characters, who are all damaged in one way or another.  The underlying theme seems to be:  ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.""  Our view of life can often be deceptive, since things aren't always what they appear to be, as Rachel eventually learns from her view on the train.  The final resolution  and conclusion were well thought out and perfect!  Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer with considerable insight into the psychological, narcissistic workings of the human mind.  Her debut novel is riveting, memorable and not to be missed."
"""The Lorien Legacies"" are a continuing book in the ""Pitticus Lore"" series that began with ""I Am Number Four"" (which was the best of the lot. I have not yet read ""The Light Between Oceans: because after the first few pages, I found that the subject matter (stealing a child by a woman who could not have her own) was more sad than dramatic. ""The Girl on the Train"" was well-written, but there were too many plot twists that really strained credibility and it portrayed women as weak and virtually helpless without a man in their life. I found that point of view disturbing."
"This would probably be considered a psychological thriller, and that it was indeed.  I never guessed what was coming until almost the end of this novel.  The characters were well-developed with great description and  excellent expression of their thoughts and feelings.  The story is told primarily from one person's point of view, but several characters, especially the other two main female characters, also weigh in and add to understanding the story. It is set in London, and the regular commuter train running through the story ties all the characters and settings together.  There is a strong message that you can never fully know what another person's life is like despite how things may seem. It is a creative and absorbing story that was impossible to put down once I got into it.  Highly recommend!"
Intriguing
Absolutely LOVED this book  Amazing beginning to end.  Now I need to see the movie!
Great story!
Loved it ( much better than the Movie Version )
Girl on a train did not get downloaded onto my kindle. Can you help?
"Sorry, but this definitely is not up to the standard of ""Gone Girl"" or Hitchcock!  The main character is not at all likeable nor sympathetic.  Her self-destructive behavior becomes repetitious and boring.  The ending is predictable and unoriginal, like a B movie.  Don't waste your time."
Couldn't put it down!
Maybe I was expecting too much based on all of the hype.  I was disappointed.
"The story itself did not match up to the write up about it. It was lackluster, I did not identify with the main protagonist who maintains an alcoholic stupor pretty much throughout the story. The ending was just awful. If I wanted to suspend reality throughout the entire book I would read fantasy or sci fi, not fiction.Don't waste your money!"
Such. A. Great. Read.
". . . is that it gets you deeply into situations when you have only a small understanding or even a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING of what is really going on.  This situation gets even more complicated when the misunderstandings are multiplied by three different narrators, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, each with her own assumptions and misunderstandings about the other two.  And when one is an alcoholic (not recovering, unfortunately), and the other two are seductresses caught in love triangles with one another’s husbands, friends, and therapists, then it gets really complicated trying to figure out what’s real and what was only imagined or misunderstood.  That this entire narration is so interesting, really so captivating, is to the credit of author Hawkins’ considerable skills.  Not a comic, but a tragic tale, and well worth the time."
"I usually read Sci-Fi and Fantasy, with quick jumps into literature and non-fiction for a break to get an idea of what is happening in the literary world.Didn't know what to expect with this book, but the idea of unreliable narrator is always fascinating; and this book pulls it off with great aplomb.The pathos that the author is able to generate for the 'main' narrator (there are three viewpoints in this book') is impressive. I actually felt sorry and disgusted for her, in equal parts.Caveat : I never liked Ignatius in Confedarcy of Dunces, just didn't do it for me - but this worked.It's a gripping read, fast paced. Just a really well told yarn.And if, IF, anyone cares, yes, the three viewpoints are all female; but this is in no way a 'female' oriented book. It is just a good story, told in an interesting way"
"This was a pretty good story, the author didn't leave any loose ends open. It was a little bit predictable though. I had an idea of what would happen in the end, and I was mostly right. It definitely keeps you glued to those pages though. The characters aren't really at all like able. Rachel is just a sad mess. Megan is very unfaithful, although I did feel a little sympathetic towards her for certain reasons that you'll find out if you read it. Anna just seemed so whiny and just basically did everything Tom told her to do. No mind of her own almost. This is definitely worth reading though if you're into thriller/murder type books. I'll be excited to see the movie when it's released!"
"This is a book i can see becoming a made for TV movie one of these days starring Tori Spelling.  It reads just like a movie, building suspense the entire book until you finally found out who the killer was at the very end, with a nice unexpected twist.  You spend the entire book thinking that every character could've done it.  The book is a pretty fast read once you get into it, which is nice, if you are looking for that.  What bothered me was the main character, i did not find her likable and most of the time pretty downright annoying.  I wanted to shout at her ""get your s**t together!!"".Overall it's an entertaining book, my book club gave it mixed reviews, so i wouldn't necessarily tell anyone not to read it, i'm just not going to rave about it.  If you like a good ""who done it?"" type book that is a fast read, then this one could be for you.  I love a good murder mystery, but i need a little more."
"Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night! Every day she rattles down the track.  She watches the cozy homes and sees the same couple daily and has even started to feel like she knows them.  Their life-as she sees it is perfect, not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking and becomes entangled in the investigation and the lives of everyone involved.When I first began to read Girl on a Train, I found it dark and depressing.  I put it down several times as I could not become interested in the daily train rides and I found myself asking, ""Is this all there is?"" As I read through the first chapters, however, I became spellbound and couldn't wait to read on.  The story keeps you on the edge with riveting tales of intimacy and betrayal.  The characters are well-developed.  One feels a combination of emotions for Rachel including pity, empathy, disgust, and admiration.  I didn't want the book to end!"
"The beginning of this book was very slow and even towards the end it wasn't very exciting. When the book finally climaxed, it was good however I feel as though it wasn't good enough. The very ending of the book for Rachel was disappointing; during the climax of the books she became so strong but the ending described her as essentially the same person before a tragic situation - the only difference her being 20 days sober.. the previews for the movie over the novel and the description about the book really lead me to believe this book would be very exciting which sadly it didn't meet expectations..."
"This book was a quick read, it pulled me in almost immediately and did not let me go until I finished. There is a feeling of nostalgia throughout the novel that gives you the feeling that you are talking to an old friend you haven't seen in awhile, one who saw you through some difficult times. I am not the best person to review mystery novels because I usually guess who did it before the big reveal. However, I thought the author did a pretty good job of making you doubt what you thought (although she did so by painting every male character as menacing). The main character, Rachel, is pretty sad. You immediately feel bad for her and as you delve further into the story you realize just how pathetic she is. None of the characters are particularly happy or well-rounded people, the women in this story lead especially depressing lives."
"Lives up to most of the hype it has been given. And I don't say that very often when it comes to bestsellers.If I only have one criticism of the novel, it is this: the author plays with our minds a little too long and some of the suspense began to wane (for me,at least). If perhaps she would have pointed me in the direction of the killer, a little earlier, and showed the minds of the other suspects (that we all contemplated) just a little sooner, I for one would have been happier. There did come a point where both my wife and I - we read it aloud to one another - were like ""get on with it, we're ready for a climax here.""Believe it or not, there were a few grammatical mistakes (IMHO). My daughter found them as well. Otherwise it is a good quick read. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes mystery and suspense."
"If you're looking for a book that sets women back decades, if not centuries, this is a winner. Written from the perspective of 3 women, there isn't a single characteristic of any of these characters that women should be proud of. None of  the female characters have anything going on outside of the men in their lives. As Paula Hawkins tells it, all members of the female sex are unfaithful, useless, unambitious, jealous alcoholics defined solely by their ability to procreate. Meanwhile, men are just for being disloyal.The author has so much disdain for women, she can't even be bothered to call us women in the title. Instead, we're just girls.Please don't perpetuate this shallow view of women by spending a dime on this book."
"Slow build up to a predictable and terrible ending. The ending was wrapped up so fast and easy that it left me angry. Plus, I don't think some characters would act the way they did in the ending. I don't understand why the author included some items detail throughout the book and never made them relevant.Overall, this book had me interested and I liked the format, but it only let me down completely. Who wraps up a story like this in a few paragraphs?"
"Go on to amazon.co.uk and read the book's reviews there for a more accurate take on the book.This is not a thriller. During the first 70% of the book this is an examination of the angst suffered by three unlikable middle class British housewives The plot is wafer thin and is presented via exposition and resolution in the last 10% of the book. If you are looking for the next Gone Girl, keep looking"
"I was recommended this book from Buzfeed's article about books with plot twists. Plot twists, this book did deliver, but all the action is in the last hundred or so pages....all pages  before hand are so much of Rachel drinking, either puking or crying, forgetting what she's doing or has done....just over and over. It got old after a while. Once the plots twists finally came, it did get exciting and I will admit I was shocked and surprised. I ended up appreciating 2 characters I loathed in the beginning. I would've  rated this higher if Rachel weren't so hard follow and hard to *want* to be on her side."
"I absolutely loathe having to push myself to finish a book and that is exactly what this book is forcing me to do.  I'm sad and annoyed that I spent the money on this one, which is why I feel the need to read to the end.  All of the characters are annoying, thin, shallow, and fairly bland.  The main character is amazingly stupid with her constant whining about messing up and then doing the same things over and over.  The worst part is having to read the same scenes and thoughts repeatedly . . . talk about boring!  I saw the ending after the first couple of chapters, but kept telling myself ""no, this has to get better than that!""  It didn't.  I'm honestly surprised and appalled that so many people enjoy this book.  It's nothing new or interesting past the free preview section, in fact it's just more of the same contrived garbage all the way to the obvious and bland ending.  Where are the good and enjoyable novels anymore?  Not here, I can promise you that!"
"I am not into murder-mystery books. At all.I cringe at the suggestion of them. Just not my thing.However, I kept seeing this book at the top of the lists and it had over 500 hold requests at the library--so of course, I had to read it. There must be a reason it's so poplar, right?I got the Kindle sample but it wasn't enough. So I bought the full version and, well, it sucked me in. At first because I could relate to Rachel. Then the story started to unfold and things were twisting and turning and I simply could NOT stop reading.I suspected one person for the better part of the book, then another, butNever who it turned out to be, although thinking back, there were plenty of clues.The author did an amazing job with this! I'm impressed!Normally I am not happy with the way these books end, but I was actually pleased with this one. I felt peaceful about it.Good read. Highly recommended!"
"The book has a strong plot. If you like mysteries, I recommend it. It moves along at a steady pace and has an interesting style: It is written from the point of view of primarily three women, mostly two. Early on the voices of these women were quite different, but as the book progressed it got harder and harder to distinguish them, which might have been intentional. I didn't know ""who did it"" until it was revealed, so kudos to the author for that. My main complaint is that I didn't find any of the characters likeable, but that might be less of an issue in the movie (I love Emily Blunt)."
"A murder mystery with twists and turns reminiscent of Gone Girl.  Rachel, an unemployed, alcoholic divorced woman, rides the train pretending to go to work every day in order to keep her unemployment a secret from her landlord / roommate.  Every day the train stops at a signal, where Rachel people watches and makes up imaginary scenarios for a couple that lives in a home across the tracks.  One day Rachel sees something shocking and decides that what she has seen will help solve the disappearance / murder mystery of the woman she has been watching from the train.  The police, understandably, do not find Rachel a credible witness.  She becomes increasingly, obsessively involved in this mystery.  Told through the voices of the different characters in the story, jumping back and forth in time, this story is engaging and well written.  I enjoyed it very much.  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I figured out the end of the mystery about 3/4 into the book."
"I got off to a slow start, had to re-read the beginning to keep the key characters apart.  The three primary characters are all speaking in first person so at first they were all running together, to me.  But after the first few chapters, it hooked me.  It is a true ""who done it"" - and I was surprised.  Had some theories through the whole book but they were knocked away."
"Many suspenseful events in this novel that it was difficult to predict until the very end.  The main character Rachel, seemingly simple and bored  is actually quite complex.  She had many emotional problems of her own creation, so it was difficult to understand her behavior and whyshe continually made poor choices.  This developed a love/hate relationship for her character.  A good read!!"
"finally gave in & bought this book because of the reviews & popularity. It certainly is a page turner but I felt uncomfortable & uneasy thru the whole book. I wanted to shout at Rachel aren't the words ""no"" or ""appropriate"" in your vocabulary? Anna was truly evil & Megan was somewhat of a loose cannon. The men were awful, how could 2 such alike persons live doors away from each other & be involved with the same 3 woman. The set up of the book, days divided into morning & evening was alright but in some cases the story went back in time & had me very confused.  I'm not sorry I read this book, it just left me with some morbid feelings. Not scared, just creepy-like every noise in the house made me jump. Would i recommend this book to anyone? If you enjoy reading & experiencing different scenarios go for it. But read it real fast, very easy to do, & have another book to delve into right away so those creepy feelings don't stay with you."
"I found the first 70 pages quite boring and had a hard time getting into this book, but I began to like it a bit more as it progressed. It may be confusing at first because the story is told from different narrative points of view, three to be exact, and because it is not written in linear or chronological order; it goes from present to past and back again, so the reader has to look at both the date and the name at the beginning of each chapter to ascertain from whose point of view the chapter is being told and when the events occurred. The three main female characters are not very likeable and have unpleasant characteristics throughout the book; however, they become more likeable at the end which is the best part of the entire book. It dragged at times, and I wasn't really engaged in it during most of the book, but once I got into it, I wanted to finish it."
"I liked the way the described the feelings of each of the female characters, you can see traits of yourself in each one of them, they are so realistic.I would mainly recommend this book to women, men may find it hard to connect with, since it has got a female point of view.I gave it a 5 stars rating cos I found it very well written, and although it is a fiction novel, you get. So mucho involved in the plot."
"I was hooked after the first page...and because I was stuck on an airplane going overseas I read the book straight through.  I loved the development of the story..good character development for this type of genre and the story was very clever and fresh.  It definitely had that familiar GONE GIRL suspense element that draws the reader through the book ""looking"" for answers.  I felt that the story was well crafted, did not give hints about the ""truth"" for at least three quarters of the book, adding doubts and twists along the way so the reader is not really certain until almost the end what really happened.I would absolutely recommend this book as a fast read, one that you really can't wait to get back to reading. I sort of hated for it to end because I was rooting for the main character and was curious about what was going to happen to her...but was glad to finally have closure on the story."
"Thin, repetitive storyline. We've heard this plot before -- but never as poorly executed. The characters, dialogue and premise is a huge cliche. It's sort of like a British Desperate Housewives of classless losers on Blenheim Road -- except the TV show, Desperate Housewives, was inventive, clever and entertaining in its tongue-in-cheek comedy/drama/mystery. Here, everyone on Blenheim Road has a secret ugly scheme.The characters are one dimensional, boring and any reveals are trite and telegraphed long before you read them. Despite the fact that Rachel and Anna constantly and intensely clash throughout the entire book, here's a revelation that Rachel has in the last quarter of the book: ""Something's not right and I can't shake the feeling that it has to with Anna.""  Really? Ya think?? How did this book get so many thousands of 4 & 5-star reviews?? Something's not right -- for sure."
"I was very engaged in reading The Girl On the Train!  It drew me in immediately through its tone and setting. I wanted to find out more about this girl on the train. What did she see? Why was she on the train?  The tone was mysterious and I wanted to know why!I was drawn to Rachel's pain. I couldn't imagine why she sought such relief through her drinking. What kind of pain drove her to seek out oblivion.  The description of her drinking was well done.  Her pain is palpable, you can almost taste her drinks and you can almost feel her hangovers.A painful tale of hurt and deception and ultimately triumph I believe.There was unfinished ideas that kept me from five stars. It left some significant holes that needed closure."
confusing characters..movie prefers don't appeal to me either..would not recommend this book..i am an avid reader and just finished the book because it have been on best seller list for so long..thought it would get betterb. crane
"I found the main character, Rachel, so pathetic at first that I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish this book.  Since it was was selected by our book club, I pushed myself to keep reading.  It did get better but was pretty predictable. The story is about a women who watches a couple from the morning train while she commutes into London.  She watches them out on their back patio and has made up fictional names and fictional lives for them.  One day she sees something that doesn't look right to her and this puts her in a tailspin.  Her ex-husband happens to live a few doors down from this couple with his new wife that he left Rachel for in her old house.  This complicates things because she cannot let go of the fact that she is still in love with her ex so she ends up stalking him which puts her in a position to stalk the other couple as well.  There are lots of twists to the story but I saw a lot of them coming before they happened."
"Well, I just wanted to write a review that would've helped me if I had seen it before reading this book...If you're bored and need something to do, read it, but it's not as notable as the hype was all about. It was slow and the only great part was the end, not the ending though. It all builds up to one point, and you have to struggle to get there. The lives are intertwined very unrealistically and everyone is painted as the ""bad guy"". I do like the view of the book through an alcoholic, it adds a different feel and makes you doubt what you are reading. This book does not compare AT ALL to Gone Girl. Not even close."
"I really enjoyed reading this book.  My sister loaned me her audio copy but, I had a hard time staying focused on it.  I gave it back to her and bought it so I could read it.  It was much better for me to read it, I think because of how she changes the perspective from one character to another, it was easier for me to follow the written version.  I have bought another hard copy to give as a gift."
"I liked the idea of the book but not the complete execution.  It's difficult for the reader to really like or relate to any of the characters.  Although I did feel like the descriptions of Rachel's battle with alcohol to be sometimes somewhat compelling.  I really did feel her want/need for a drink.The reader is trying to figure out 'who done it?' BUT the author did not really give us enough clues for us to have any idea what she had in mind. I partially understand that is because we are supposed to be seeing through the eyes of the various characters but I felt as if I wanted a little more depth and nuance that would clue us in (ever so slightly) as to what the endgame would be.  When things become apparent, I was surprised but didn't feel enough excitement for the 'AH-HA' moment.  I felt like I was kind of cheated by being completely blinded from all of what was really going on."
"I bought this book for my wife, and she has had nothing but good words for it. She has tried a number of times to get me to read it and I'm sure one of these days I will. We have the Kindle version so unless we lose our e-reader the book will always be available. My eysight is bad so I am subscribed to a Talking Library organization and they recently sent me a recorded version of the book. If they have it in their collection it has to be a good book. Doing this review has brought the book to the top of my list of things to do so I have to get started on it. Book reviews and my wife highly recommend this book so I would say get it, and enjoy!  JLM"
"It was terrible.  The two main female characters Rachel/Megan were consistently unlikeable.  No redeeming qualities.  Hard to stay with a story when you don't like the characters. The story line was confusing, ""is she lying"" or ""isn't she"".  That got old. When it could be followed, it was uninteresting.  I gave up a little past half way and skipped to the end due to a book club review.  All of my book club felt the same, and we rarely agree.  ""Best seller"" because large numbers of people were buying it under the premise that being on ""the best seller"" list means it is well written.  Not so."
"I hate books and movies where all the suspense is created by the narrator being an idiot, making avoidable mistakes. This tale is told by a drunk who creates all of her own problems and whose myriad mistakes made while hammered are only reason book isn't 50 pages long. I figured out who did it pretty early on, which is not to say im that smart, but that this book is that unsmart. It is similar to gone girl in that it's an unreliable narrator situation (which seems to be the only way that anyone can write an interesting suspense novel these days).  Not hitchcockian in the least----pretty TV movie. This is a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on Gillian Flynn's writing style,  but not well-written or sufficiently entertaining for me to read the remaining third. Save your money and your time---I wish I had."
"I truly hated this book...annoying character who kept getting drunk...just plain uninterested in what happened to anybody.  I CANNOT understand the popularity unless we are a truly dumbed down audience or the marketing department is very very good.....There are so many wonderful books out there, don't waste your time."
This book was such a disappointment.  80% of the book was a page turner written by a gifted writer. However the conclusion is so juvenile one would think you were reading a 15 year old's high school assignment. The literary quality of the book completely fell apart at the end.
"Although Ms. Hawkins' writing style is engaging and original, I found the story to be overly gruesome and the turn of events unbelievable.  None of the characters were likable - there was no one to root for - and I grow ever more tired of stories about people whose only concerns are getting laid and ruining their health one way or another.  This will perhaps make a mildly diverting made-for-TV movie one day, but steer clear otherwise."
"I have to say, I found this book depressing, boring in some spots, and hard to read. I grew up with an alcoholic mother, so this was tough reading. for me.The story keeps switching around the 3 ladies in the book and it got tough staying on point. I agree with a few reviewers that Anna and Megan should have been built up more, although this book was all about Rachel.Rachel in an alcoholic and has a 'black night' of drinking and the entire book works around, ""What happen that night."" It was a good mystery because I never guessed who the killer was until the end of the book. But getting to the end was tough. You have to pay attention to dates and who is talking to even figure out what is going on.Reading fiction is supposed to take you away and be relaxing. This is not that kind of book. I'm not sure I even know what happens to Rachel, I was so caught up in trying to figure who was telling the story in this book. For me, it just solved the mystery, but I didn't feel that the story of Rachel ended. Maybe it was just me.Even though most reviewers have reviewed this book above 3, I would not recommend it. It was not a pleasant experience for me. Please understand it could be because of the alcoholism, that isn't a pleasant memory, and it took me back there. I only bought this book because of the +20 thousand people who reviewed the book. I know more than that have read it, and for me, I wonder why?"
"On the plus side while I could put this book down I did feel a compelling need to go back and finish it.  There is an engaging mystery and a truly scary climax.  Three stars for that.On the minus side--the three main characters are women who in a sense are clones of each other--totally focused on the man in their lives and on actual or wished for children.  No careers, no quirks.  Weak and drippy.  The overall mood of the book is depressing.  When these characters did something strong it was either recklessly stupid or out of character.There is also the Agatha Christie cliché of the culprit at the end spilling the beans about what really happened while someone is (figuratively) tied to the railroad tracks.  That was old with Agatha Christie.The originality and unique take on contemporary life that you'll find in Gone Girl is simply not here, plus the whole view of life and women's lives in particular is just a downer.  The writing is okay but the three narrators all are alike in how they express themselves."
"WAS THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!So many lost opportunities, a poor plot line and NO twist or connection in the end between the characters:Tom? what? who cares about that guy. He gives his story up so easily in the end, really? he doesn't even transform as a character before that.What happened to all of the pieces of clothing that Rachel sees on her trips? that provides suspense in the beginning but means nothing.The ENTIRE story about Megan really doesn't mean anything - in the end, it doesn't even matter that she had/killed a baby (it doesn't even have anything to do with her death), the dr. Abdul guy storyline is a total waste.Scott is the lousiest character ever - what is the whole end fight with Rachel for?And Anna just puts her girl to bed and has a beer when Tom is confessing? lamewhat about the guy with the red hair?"
"I'm actually surprised that this book is as popular as it is, when there are so many good ones out there right now.  I've seen this book compared to Gone Girl, and I don't understand because while it has a similar premise, (missing girl, murder, intrigue) it was entirely less interesting and surprising, although I will admit that The Girl on the Train did keep me in suspense for the first half.  It seemed like the author had a great idea with a girl on a train, studying people's lives as she passed by, but then it got muddled by a bunch of affairs and entirely too attractive people.Ultimately I was rooting for this book to be better, but the characters were not relatable or realistic in my opinion, and it seemed like I was watching a soap opera."
"My book club selected this book.  I wasn't even half way through and had to torture myself to finish it.  Very slow moving, somewhat predictable, with characters in bad places who are so unlikeable that you can't even feel sympathy for them.  Too many people making bad, selfish, stupid choices which will lead them to the inevitable.  The train rides take up a large portion of the story, which was mostly dull. I could not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone."
I wanted to like this book. I did. But it was SO morose and depressing. It was horrible go through the main characters alcoholism with her. Perhaps that is a credit to the author. I had figured out who had done it about half way through. Initially I was totally confused as to whose voice I was reading and had to go back and read again. I just wasn't paying attention to the chapter titles. By the end I felt myself thinking that that was a very depressing trip without a lot of excitement. I mean I read the whole thing. It was okay. Not sure what the hype is all about.
"A cleverly constructed story written from the perspectives of the three main female characters, Rachael, Megan, and Anna.  Rather than numerical chapters, each chapter is named for whomever happens to be telling the story from their point of view at the time.  This transforms into a gripping and exciting yarn about love found, then tragically lost.  It touches upon the insidious and hopeless consequences of alcoholism, infidelity, and ultimately cold and calculated murder.  This is not a happy story with a fairytale ending.  It left me feeling glad it was over but satisfied I stayed with it."
"I have never understood the fascination with books about mentally unstable protagonists. Personally Like with ""Gone Girl"" I find it very hard to either connect or sympathise with these unstable and very often unpleasant characters. The drunken heroine never really grows or develops beyond the initial introduction and she is just boring by the end of the novel. The fact that the second wife turns out to be as unstable as her does nothing to mitigate the boredom, in fact you just begin to wonder if there are any normal people in this fictional world or if everyone is determined to be dysfunctional."
A very good read. Story is told by three female characters. Mood is ominous all through the book. Rachel is the main character. She is divorced from her husband who has remarried and has a daughter with his new wife Anna. Rachel is not able to accept her changed situation even though she initiated the divorce when she caught her husband red-handed with Anna. The marriage was falling apart even before as Rachel was not able to conceive. Rachel takes a train every day to London even though she has lost her job there. She watches her old house and a neighbor's from the train. She is able to observe what is going on the porches of these home. The couple in the neighboring house seem to be greatly in love until one day Megan the wife is found murdered. Murderer's identity remains secret almost until the end.
"I found this to be a solid, enjoyable thriller. The story is told in the first person by the three female protagonists. One of the threads is deferred significantly in time. This structure works quite well to produce the suspense on which the success of this type of narrative depends. It perhaps falters a little however in its depiction of the male characters. We see then through the women’s eyes but really don’t get enough food for thought about them to enable us to make an educated guess about their role in the novel’s key event. It terms of style, it has its moments, not least the following keen observation about the British urban landscape:“a 1960s new town, spreading like a tumour over the heart of Buckinghamshire. No better or worse then a dozen other towns like it, a centre filled with cafes and mobile-phone shops and branches of JD Sports, surrounded by a band of suburbia and beyond the realm of the multiplex cinema and out-of-town Tesco”"
"It was well written, but excruciatingly boring. The only excitement I felt was when I was finished. I can't imagine why they would make this book into a movie, that would be a total bore.Besides the very end of the book this wasn't very interesting. None of the characters were likable, in fact I hated them all. Not one favorite. Waste of my time."
"I enjoyed this book - it kept me interested, but all-in-all, it was just okay. It reminded me a lot of Gone Girl, which I liked better than this one. I felt it dragged on a bit (she's a drunk, we get it), but it was still suspenseful. I did guess (correctly) who the killer was mid-book, so the ending wasn't very exciting...it was just a confirmation of what I already knew. Would I recommend it anyway? Probably."
"A slog of a read.  I stuck with it to the very end, but it's only really gripping in the last 2% (I read on Kindle).  The timeline can be ignored--it adds nothing but confusion and helps the reader not in the least.  The writing is pedestrian.  The characters not sharply delineated, they tend to blend into each other.  And enough with the booze motive.  It got it right away, and the author just belabors the same stuff over and over.  Probably better off if you pay the money for the movie.  The cost would be similar, it will take less of your time, plus you can have popcorn.  Not recommended."
"This book had me guessing one thing was happening, when it was quite another.  It was a very decent read, but I can't help feel it could have been so much more with the premise and start of the story being as thought out as it was.  The story revolves around a divorcee who binge drinks and her inability to be a 'reliable' witness in a missing persons case. This could have gone many ways, but ended up with all the males in the story being  users of the women they were with in many different incarnations. This was more the crux of the story; rather than being a mystery (which it still was) it was also a statement on the abusive side of relationships. I would go 3 1/2 stars, but you can't do halves.  It's better than average and and entertaining to read, but still have that gnaw in my gut that it could have been plotted into something much more.  I think the author has a good start to her career here though."
"I am at a loss why everyone is raving about this book and find it ""hard to put down.""  Rachel is exhausting - at first you feel sorry for her and empathize with her, but after about 100 pages of her grasping at her formal life while she is constantly drunk - it gets old really quick.  Anna is a the girl we all hate - loving playing the mistress and enjoying every second of knowing she is stealing a married man.  Megan is just a clingy train wreck, and the men are all portrayed to be scary/sleezy.  Like Gone Girl, there really isn't one character that you can actually like let alone root for.  Halfway through the book I guessed the ending...there is only a handful of characters, so it's not hard to figure out where this is going. Zero twists, worst boring ""suspense"" (I use the term loosely) book....can't believe they are making this into a movie!"
"This book kept plodding towards the inevitable. I knew who the killer was early in the book. Yet I kept reading in fascination, thinking that surely it couldn't be THAT obvious. Well, it was obvious. I found the main character, Rachel, to be really pathetic and, quite frankly, kind of weird. I did not have any sympathy for her at all. Please, don't waste your time reading this book. I don't know why it got so many great reviews."
"I had to drag myself through this book from beginning to end, and I only finished it because my Book Group is reading it. I thought the writing was shallow and the characters, all of them, were vague and difficult to relate to. I was particularly impatient with the main character, Rachel, in that I thought the author was using her repeated alcoholic episodes as a crutch to extricate herself from having to fully write the exposition. I notice that this book has been compared repeatedly to another terrible book, ""Gone Girl"", and I think that is accurate. If you were impatient with the bad writing, plot and character development in ""Gone Girl"", you will find the exact same weaknesses in ""Girl on the Train"". Inexplicable plot development, unclear and superficial characters, a boring, boring story, and an unsatisfying ending. Don't waste your time."
"I could not believe that Ms. Hawkins could write a book where the ""Girl on the Train"" was such a sad character who happens to be addicted to the awful disease of alcoholism.  It is a shame that this disease's consequences were used to create a most predictable story.  How anyone can say that this is the next ""Gone Girl"" is delusional.  Shame on the author."
"I so wanted to like this book! The beginning was slow but I had nothing else to read so I continued. Then I starting hating the main character because she hated herself; her decision making was beyond poor and her drinking was beyond boring.  In fact all the characters were exaggerated caricatures of ""flawed"" people.  But it was the ending that killed this book. Without providing any spoilers, I absolutely could not believe the ending of the book!  It read like a tired Law and Order: SUV episode (I actually said out loud: are you KIDDING me?).  Before killing off the witnesses, the killer sits there and confesses while everyone drinks tea. Then the protagonist plans his/her suspenseful escape (read the book to see if the escape was successful).  Completely predictable plot line with a boringly predictable ending. Totally unrealistic.  The premise was interesting and might have been better developed by a different author.  This is my honest opinion on how I felt about the book, and what I would have wanted to know before I read it."
"The first chapters of this book got me hooked, but it soon became tedious to be inside the mind of a self pitying alcoholic for so long.  Every character in the story was despicable, which does not bode well when one has to spend so much time inside their heads . When the mystery was finally revealed - after too much drinking, whining, and sniveling by nearly everyone, but especially the main protagonist - I was angry that I'd wasted both my time and my money."
"The book is written in the same switchback method as 'Gone Girl' and for a while it's an engrossing thriller.  However, the train slows down in the last  30 pages or so, and the killer and ending is not the shocker one would expect from this highly praised story.  More character development would have helped but very little background is provided for each, and what there is exists mostly in conversations.  A good book, but not really deserving of all the hype."
"I have the biggest problem with what passes for psychological thrillers these days.  This and ""Gone Girl"".  I got nothin'.  As in ""Gone Girl"", not one of these characters is (a) likable, (b) believable, or (c) all that interesting.  So why keep reading?  Our protagonist, Rachel, is anything but.  She's so irritating that you want to reach through the pages and slap her around.  Truly, she has so few redeeming qualities that I was not rooting for her in any way, shape or form.  Kind of wishing she was the one that got offed.  Any time there was a stupid thing that could be done, she managed to find something even more stupid and then do THAT thing.  Then she'd get drunk, black out and feel even worse.  I should have put the book down when she vomited on her roommate's rug and then pitched into a drunken blackout and left it there. (Oh, was that a spoiler?  Sorry, my bad.)  And then, you know, there's that thing that happens where after the first four chapters or so, the story is laid out and then nothing much happens -- it's just filler -- until the last chapter when everything resolves.  So there are about 100 or so wasted pages.  Not great.  I'm sure they're doing casting calls for the movie as I write this."
"The whole premise of this book was so insipid, like the writer was noodling around for a cute idea to write about as she sat on the train to work. And she started writing and wasn't at all sure where to go with it so she tried making the characters intriguing, but they weren't. Many of the voices were so similar you couldn't tell who was speaking except by looking at the very pale gray label at the top of the page. The people she portrayed were really pathetic, totally lacking a raison d'etre in life. I finished the book because I had nothing else to read at the moment."
"This is a horribly boring ""thriller"". To me there are three key elements to every mystery/ thriller - plot, character, writing. This book is sadly lacking on all accounts. The plot is ok but I figured things out about half way through and I kept plodding toward the conclussion (counting the pages to the enevitable end). The characters were sad, one dimensionioal set pieces that never come to life. The shifting narative was gimmicky at best and a lazy writing style at worst (meaning all we can expect of Ms. Hawkins is more of the same). I have no idea how this became a Number 1 best seller on the NYT list (I guess because of suckers like me). By far the worst book I have read this year (15)."
"I have to be honest even with all the amazing reviews I still think I barely liked it.  I bought it because of the zillion good reviews and I am sure that is why most are buying it.SPOILER:I am ok at predicting plot twists but I feel like this one was very very obvious. I mean from the second they tell you Megan babysat and he smiled at her and then a few pages later ""he"" smiled at her driving by it was very obvious that it was Tom...I mean you can't help but compare it to Gone Girl and although I did not like the ending of Gone Girl , Gone Girl blows this book out of the water. Flynn's book is so smart and clever this is kind of boring and mostly about an alcoholic who you don't feel for and I could not even get myself to like a single character or be interested in any of them.I did not care for it at all to each his/her own."
"All I can say after forcing myself to finish this ""novel""  is that the book should have been called the drunk girl on the train. With its predictable plot, undeveloped and unlikeable characters, ""The Girl on a Train"" reads like something one would pick up at an airport newsstand to kill some time. I was numb with disbelief when the ""mystery"" was revealed at the end. I couldn't believe the author would pull the most obvious literary trick out of the hat to reveal the murderer. The lead character is in a drunken fugue for most of the book but clarity returns right at the end along with a smug confession by the killer.The key players were a circle of six which included a pathetic drunk, a mistress-turned wife, an adulteress, a serial liar/cheater, a paranoid husband, and a shady therapist...with some random red-haired man thrown in the mix. No wonder it garnered so many ""five-star reviews,"" and being adapted into a movie...it's suspense-lite that appeals to the masses and will have many flocking to the cinema to see this easy-to-solve-mystery. Most notably, many of the five star reviews are from professional bloggers and vine reviewers who receive free ARC's. I suppose that one too many a critical review would stop those freebies from coming.I am so irritated that I bought this book in hard back, but I guess this is my comeuppance for buying into the summer book reading hype. Hitchcockian this is not, not even close."
"The concept of the story is good, but the book rambles on and on with a predictable two page conclusion.  Don't waste your money on this one."
"I was not fond of this book because the characters were all such awful people. One after another, they were so messed up.  The book was redundant, yeah, we know Rachel is a boring drunk, we know Megan is a loser.  Both men are horrible!  I can't believe I finished the book. No surprises, since we already knew Megan was having an affair.  Duh.I know we all have our flaws, but I truly have never met anyone like these people.  Maybe I'm just lucky, or don't live in the bottom of a barrel."
"I have about 75 more pages until I'm finished with this book. Yes, it's been dragging along for me and there are a few reasons:  1. The main characters lack real depth. I want to empathize or ""side"" with at least one of the characters but being unformed, they come across as one-dimensional and simply self-absorbed; 2. The book lacks suspense. The pace of the book is erratic because the author jumps back and forth in time for all of the main characters. These ""interruptions"" stall any suspense that should be building and growing and; 3. Like a STEREOTYPICAL day in London, the tone of the of the book is grey and gloomy which equated to dull for me.  I really wanted to like this book like the majority of reviewers and be able to tell friends and relatives, "" You really need to read this book!""  Not the case here.......but that's just my opinion."
"I was so disappointed in this book.  Hours of listening to an audio book that was full of codependent, bad decision making, weak women.  I kept hoping something would get better and that there would actually be at least one character that I liked and it never happened.  I must stop falling for books just because they are on a best-seller list.  Bad choice on my part and a lesson learned to read customer reviews before I buy."
"Sorely disappointed and difficult to follow especially on a device - had a hard time figuring out who was who and who belonged to who - finally had to write down a flow chart so I didn't have to flip around in my Kindle. And Rachel - honestly, she was ridiculous ---are there people really and truly that stupid? I know there are people who are stuck and cannot make a good decisions for various reasons, but Rachel takes the cake. Not worth reading. Sorry I wasted time on this book."
"Not one sympathetic character in the book.  Five main characters and not one of them has any redeeming values.  If this is the world Hawkins lives in, she has my utmost sympathy.  It is one of the worst books I have read in a long time and I read a LOT of books. If you want mystery/thrillers stick with Sandford, Child, Connelly, Silva, Flynn, Baldacci, Coben, DeMille, Thor, etc.  Do not spend your time or money on this book.  You'll regret it."
"I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting..."
"I gave it one star because the author wrote it but I did not like any of the book. I do not like to read about alcoholics, did not find any saving grace in the life of a woman who let the end of her marriage push her to the limits.  Where was her self respect?  There is a sinister allegorical theme woven throughout the story. Unless you want to read misery, skip this one.  Okie Reading Specialist"
"I absolutely agree with all the other one-star reviewers.  This book was a big disappointment.  It's a blow-by-blow description of the protagonist's days, which early on gets boring.  The characters, especially the women, are self-involved losers who refuse to improve their lives.  In fact, all the characters in the book are stereotypes; none is interesting.  I hurried through to the end of the book just to get it over with, and I too wish I had my time back.  So much for a New York Times best-seller -- that praise means nothing."
"Though the book has dominated the NYT bestseller list for months, I was not impressed.  From an English mystery, I expected more color, an eccentric sleuth with more expertise, a distinctive setting, a little charm, perhaps a dash of humor;  instead, Train offers an alcoholic slouch with a dreary commute to nowhere.  The biggest mystery in the book is the heroine's blackouts.  The murder is so banal, without passion and inept that it is literally a crime committed without a trace of motive or evidence.  The heroine, generally in a drunken stupor, has some encounters of interest but mostly stumbles around totally clueless and solves the mystery completely by accident.  The accidental solution to the clueless mystery, finally gives readers a taste of redemption and a glimpse of evil.  This is not a case of leaving the best for last; those ingredients could have spiced up the tale and made the ride less tedious."
"Careful reading at first will help the reader get the five main characters in focus, and some patience is needed with Rachel.  However,  one is so rewarded by the exciting plot as it unfolds, taking the reader through twist after psychological twist.  I enjoyed the luxury of POV renderings of each character, and the clever way the author left clues for me to think about as the end rushed toward me like a Runaway Train trying to reach its station before the good are not saved and the bad are not caught..  The author makes you care so much for each character, regardless of their weaknesses. Will their strengths of character emerge to bring this complicated human puzzle to a satisfying end? Or will the reader be left asking more questions and be enticed to want more about the future of these characters and those their lives touched?  What an intriguing ride!"
"Ugh, the best part of this book is that it eventually ends and you feel better.  To me, the mystery notwithstanding, the hardest thing about this book was how incredibly hard it was to like ANY of the characters.  I find it very hard to read a book when I'm not able to really root for anyone.  But, I thought it was a decent enough mystery.  Didn't figure it out way in advance of the end but the possible murderers that the reader is supposed to suspect come across as so deliberately red herrings.  So it becomes a game of who's left after you eliminate the other possible suspects.  If this were not a book group selection I probably wouldn't have finished.  However, it gets two stars instead of one from me because at the end, I did develop some empathy for our drunken heroine.  So, there was that."
"I agree with some other reviewers. The characters in this novel were all annoying and not believable.  The main character, Rachel, you just want to reach out and smack some sense into her.  I just keep reading so I could be done with it. It is one crazy female after another, surrounded by awful men. I fail to see why this book is getting so many good reviews. Stay away."
"Well, it is definitely a summer chick book.  The protagonist, big surprise, is a female, whose life is falling apart.  In the spirit of Rear Window (only Jimmie Stewart does it justice) she sees something that's not right and immediately she makes a gazillion unfounded assumptions (like Rear Window and that other flick with Shia Labeouf).  It gets interesting, finally 2/3 into the book, but you can tell that the target audience of this book was not male.  Woman will love the personal relationships sprinkled with the protagonists imagination, and they may even identify with the other female characters in the book, but overall, it was like watching a trainwreck:  I couldn't NOT finish it, but I;'m not sure I wanted to.  Ladies, you'll love it.  Guys, try Secretary Gates' book or An Army at Dawn this summer..."
"Two things led me to pick this book to read. First one is the fact that this book belonged to psychological thriller genre and second is it being the top seller on Amazon for consistent weeks. However, after completing the book, I should say it was an above average read (falls short when compared to Gone Girl). The story as it progresses is quite intriguing and keeps the reader hooked, but as it nears the end, the story becomes a tad predictable. The story is centered around Rachel, the protagonist who is made to believe that she doesn't remember anything after black out, but one day she ends up being a witness to a murder when she is totally drunk. How she decides and interprets the events of that day forms the crux of the story. I definitely liked the way, the story is presented with careful juggling of the events from the past year and the present date. To summarize, I would say it is a good read."
"This was an enjoyable book with plenty of twists and turns to keep me turning the pages. While there were parts of the book that were predictable, Hawkins does a nice job of keeping the reader guessing about the outcome. While at times I wanted to know more about certain characters in the book, they were developed well enough that i found myself connecting with them emotionally from start to finish. The story is told from the viewpoints of the three main female characters (Rachel, Megan and Anna), which adds to the mystery and emotion of the story. The pace of this book is enjoyable - while I was eager to get to the end of the story, at the same time, there were moments when taking a rest from the sadness that often defined Rachel's life became necessary for me emotionally. It was a good book, and a relatively quick read."
"This was so badly written I gave up at 50%. Writing from three different women's perspectives yet they all sound just the same? Unbelievable sightings from the train, shallow character development. Why is this so popular??"
"It was a downer for the most part .  Rachels alcohol issues were way overstated, and none of the characters wereParticularly likeable.  They all seemed needy, spoiled, neurotic, or vacant.  What I disliked most was that she waspretty vague at the beginning when you were trying to figure things out, and then she discloses pertinent information toward the end. For a mystery writer, it's sort of a cheating tactic. Better to have good clues throughout the book that continue to unfold to build the mystery evenly.  It was very spotty and uneven,and none of the characters had much depth or character!"
"Very enjoyable!  Hard to put down.  The author, characters and plot make you want to keep going right until the end.  I tend to get so caught up in the action that I read less for comprehension than to FINISH!  As much as I enjoy switching between the characters voices, the change in the time was more than I could manage easily.  But the book was written well enough so that even if you weren't paying attention to the dates, you could almost always figure out when you were based on the events.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it's been so built up in the media, by the time I read it, it was less than I expected."
Easy reading
"The story was compelling from the beginning, even though it took awhile to get into it and figure out how it was written. Each chapter is told from a different character's viewpoint, so we learn the 'truth' about things and then another's perception of the same things. The main character has lost her job, but rides the train every day into town so her roommate won't know she is unemployed. Suffering from low self-esteem, she drinks more than she should and subsequently suffers from the occasional blackout. She passes by the same houses every day, and has made up stories about a particular couple, imagining their perfect life. When the female part of the couple goes missing, the main character inserts herself into the investigation, sure she has information that is valuable. As the mystery deepens, she then wonders if she was somehow involved, as she had a 'blackout' episode at the time of the disappearance. For me, the plot took a strange, unlikely turn, and the lead character was not a very sympathetic character. The format reminded me of ""Gone Girl"", which was a much better story."
"I really wanted to love this book and had high hopes based on other reader comments.  I greatly enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" but this book pales in comparison.  The 3 female characters with alternating POVs are all pathetic. Their middle class problems seem so first world and were not compelling.  One of the females, Megan, and one of the 2 main male characters, Tom, are conveniently compulsive liars and cheats and no one ever meets the parents or family of either (Megan's family conveniently dead, Tom's estranged) -- it felt so contrived! Then to add the final insult SPOILER ALTER -- pathetic Rachel (who is a white, educated, middle class adult, presumably in her 30's) ends up having everything worked out when her mother coughs up some money for her to get back on her feet and get a fresh start. Rachel didn't do anything real to rebuild her life or improve herself. Saved by mummy's money. Ugh!"
"Ahh, the hot best seller of the season... A good read, a solid story with solid writing and a cautionary (don't be a boozer) nugget to boot. The seemingly good characters turn out to be much worse people than expected--and visa versa. We observe a semi-likable protagonist swimming upstream against a current of alcoholism, trying to clear her head and remember what happened the night she came home bloodied and a woman from a nearby neighborhood vanished. The ""surprise ending"" seemed over the top, a bit of story-telling hyperbole that didn't really fit with the tone and weight of the preceding tale. A decent book that proves once again the fallacy of looking for greatness or literature among the best sellers."
"I probably would have enjoyed this more were it not for the countless ""NEXT GONE GIRL"" and ""HITCHCOCKIAN"" promises thrown around in countless reviews. I kept waiting for a twist that never came, and I was disappointed. An ok book, but nothing special ...and certainly no Gone Girl."
"The Girl on the Train, I'll admit I was sucked in from the beginning. I grabbed a bag of chips, ordered pizza, and prepared for an intriguing night in. Just me and my book. The back-and-forth, 3-narrator structure was a bit confusing at first, but I could forgive it because it added a touch more suspense and depth to the story. However, after I finished the last page (and last pizza slice) I found myself a bit hollow. The story had somehow gone from an interesting premise to an ending so formulaic, so obvious, it was, well, ludicrous. I figured out the culprit about halfway through, but I was sure I had to be wrong, that the author just wanted me to think that I knew. And I waited for the twist that never came. As I read the last few paragraphs of the climax I couldn't believe how ordinary an ending this book was turning out to have. Ms. Hawkins succeeded in churning out a uniquely premised mystery only to muddy it with a Lifetime movie ending. ""Our heroine is beat till she's bloody and battered, and just when you think she's defeated...she shocks us all with her heroic sleight of hand""....spare me. Too many coincidences made the story unbelievable and worthy of more than a few eye rolls. I gave three stars because I like her writing style and it held my interest, but the ending fell flat--like Drunk Rachel."
"This sounded so good, and the first few dozen pages were good — the three narrators do a decent job of pulling you into what begins as parallel romantic dramas, with the bulk of it all being narrated by Rachel, the ex of one of the two men (who live a couple doors away from one another). Rachel has a drinking problem, as you will soon experience in repetitive, unending, mind-numbing detail. And she has a blackout on the night in question which haunts her, because it's during that blackout that Something Happens (that's not a spoiler, it's the whole premise of the book.) Like I said, the set-up is ok, and the stories are involving, but about halfway through you realize that you're only halfway through. What, is there an index at the end that takes up a third of the book? No. I suppose to make the story plod along more ""realistically,"" the author pads the tale with a mountain of repetition (oh did I say that already? Maybe it's contagious!)  — thoughts, conversations, situations, over and over and over. It's funny — the other characters get very tired of Rachel's drama, and you can't help but sympathize. She's just as boring as drunks generally are — so I suppose the author should get credit for accurately portraying a bore. Towards the end, I wasn't even reading it anymore, I was just glancing at paragraphs to get the gist. And after all that work, the big reveal feels more like a big letdown. Skip it — you can't get those 20 hours of your life back. I say go read ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" instead."
"I can't believe all these four and five star reviews!  I had to plow through this book because I found it not only boring but distasteful, like Gone Girl.  All about sleazy people whose main occupation was having sex with each other.  The means of telling the story--first-person snippets by the three female characters--struck me as sloppy writing, an easy ""out"" that let the author not bother with the finer details of plot. And the people were not interesting!  Their lives, including those of the men, were incredibly shallow..  I am an older reader but I don't object to sex in stories, just to sloppy writing about people that are so dull and uninspiring.  But this seems to be the new trend in best-selling books which speaks to me of how readers' tastes have deteriorated."
"Almost aborted in 1st chapter.  After several, I skipped to last chapter.  That's all I needed. Rest was a laborious bore."
"It was not the worst thing I've read. But it was very, very far from the best. The author's writing is technically fine. And she does do a good job of depicting the characters and scenes. Well, that is she does if her intention was for the reader to not just dislike the characters, but to utterly abhor them. I realize that to some extent we are not supposed to like them. But usually with a cast of unlikable characters there is some redeeming value somewhere. This book had none! I didn't like the characters, but more importantly couldn't have cared less about what happened to them. I struggled to finish this book. Mostly I kept thinking I was missing something - it has gotten such great reviews that I felt like maybe just around the next page there would be something to like. Alas, there never was. A previous review stated it well - the characters are ""not merely unlikable; their un-likability is forced and exaggerated. Rachel's convenient blackouts happen so frequently as to become tedious"". Everything about this book was tedious. I can't imagine the soon-to-be-released movie will be any better!"
"I didn't start reading this book until I saw the movie trailer released. I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm certain this is one of the most suspenseful and dynamic books I have read in quite some time. The characters were relatable and complex, human and ordinary, like the person sitting next to you on a commuter train. I lost myself and the passing of time as I continued reading. I felt bad and hated each character so thoroughly I didn't want to come to the end. Great read and can't wait to be disappointed by what Hollywood leaves out in the theater."
"My sister had raved about this book so I made it a point to buy it when a discounted price became available.  Hawkins writes well and her story is quite good but I have never met a bunch of less likeable characters.  Perhaps, as a very literal person, I missed her point if Hawkins intended to portray everyone so negatively, but I like at least one person to root for in a book.  The central character was incredibly weak and seemingly proud of her inablity to pull herself out of her neediness and addicton.  The other characters were angry, selfish, violent, and/or not terribly bright.I will credit Hawkins with keeping the ending fairly opaque until near the end but this is not a book I particularly enjoyed.  Plus now I have to fib to my sister."
"I had started to read Gone Girl, but, didn't finish it because I thought the characters were pathetic people. Which, by the way, takes very good writing. But, it didn't work for me. Partway through The Girl On The Train, I thought I had another Gone Girl on my hands. No way!! I could not stop reading this book. At first I thought Rachel was just a sad, pathetic person, but, as I read more I saw the depth to her character. There are plot twists and surprises I never saw coming. I was impressed with the book. I never read books that someone ""recommends"", whether that person is a friend, celebrity, or book critic. But, my daughter told me that she heard this was good, so, I gave it a try. By the way, my daughter has the audible version and it quite impressed with the work of the voice actors and the story itself. I totally loved this book. I would read something else by this author."
I did not really like this I do not see what all the hype is gone girl was better
"I really enjoyed reading this book, I can say that probably is one of the best books I've read so far, I don't want to write any spoilers, so just keeping it simple, I will say that it had a great pace, well built  characters, the story will definitely keep you hooked the entire time, and you just need to get to the bottom of everything. I gave it the highest rating, because lets face it, the book was so freakishly awesome. I wouldn't change anything, it's a masterpiece. I totally recommend it to any avid reader who enjoys a thriller book, with some romance, suspense, and complicated situations. Thanks to the author, I look forward to read some more of her work."
"I didn't like this at first, and I thought the author had some trouble distinguishing the voice of some of the characters, but got better as it went along. Well worth the read in the end."
"I don't like to criticize any author who spends hundreds of hours writing something for readers to enjoy.Clearly, Paula Hawkins' perseverance has paid off for her since she's been on the best seller lists for many months, so who am I to go against public opinion--and the NY Times critic?At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I have to complain a bit.Using an ""unreliable narrator"" device can be tricky. There ARE authors who handle it  really well---( A Pleasure and A Calling by Phil Hogan does this beautifully, for example. ) For me, after reaching the end of Girl on a Train, rather than being delighted at being fooled, I was annoyed.  The narrator's ""inner thoughts,"" aren't really honest ones --she holds information back from whom?  Herself? Plus  the plot has so many holes in it that even the most bumbling detective would have figured out just what went on."
"The story was good, you felt for the main character and how she was dealing with her life problems.  I had a hard time staying engrossed because the author chose to not only switch between different characters' voices by chapter, but she also skipped around in time sequence.  The ending was something of a surprise.  I wouldn't rush to buy another of her books, though."
"This book was an easy read but I am not sure why it got such outstanding reviews.  Although the book was suspenseful I did find it predictable.  Too bad, I am not sure I can agree either that it was Hitchcockian.  But for those who enjoyed it, good for them.  I on the other hand don't understand they hype....Though some of the relationships were believable, others were far fetched and contrived.  Too much emphasis was put on the ""blackouts"".  Their purpose of them seemed to me to be giving the author creative license because heck she was too drunk to remember. It was a good premise but a disappointing delivery. This is my opinion, I don't like giving to many details when reviewing a book, in the event someone would like to read it anyway.  I did not hate the book so I did give it a 3 for the suspense, but with so many positive reviews this book fell short."
"I found this highly touted book to be quite boring and frankly tedious.  The main character is wading through a quagmire of depression, delusion and gin and tonics in a can.  Most of the book takes place on a commuter train; the heroine is in an inebriated haze throughout.  As a psychologist I appreciate the difficulties of depression but this book does not handle the subject well.  All of the characters are hard to empathize with so one is left with ""no horse in the race"" to root for.  There are a couple of mild surprises but I seriously would not recommend this book to any of my friends."
"I must admit that it took me two different attempts to finish this book.  The first time I started it I just couldn't really get into it...maybe because I do not like books written in the ""first person"" and I found the separate individual chapters disconcerting.  Since knowing that the highly anticipated movie was coming out shortly and the incredible number of weeks it's been on the NYT's best seller list I decided to start the book again. I did  finish it, I am glad I did, but I didn't like the writers style and thought that it certainly did not live up to it's hype."
"Read the book because I wanted to compare it versus the movie which opens in theaters today.The story is told by 3 different women. Rachel, the jobless alcoholic; Anna, the woman who married Rachel's ex-husband; and Megan, a woman that lives four doors away from Anna and Tom (Rachel's ex-husband). Each one has issues in the past and each one is ""flawed"" in their own way.I really enjoy a good plot twist and this book does not disappoint. It's been a long time since I stopped what I was doing to finish a book because I HAD to find out how it ended!"
"I read this after it was recommended by a friend. I thought it was fast paced & interesting. I'm not a big fan of ""amnesia"" murder stories because it's all too convenient. It's also frustrating! The chapters are written in different point of views. Not only do you have to pay attention to which character is narrating the chapter, but what the date is for that chapter, too. I also found it sad that I didn't like any of the characters. Every time I thought that maybe a character was okay, something would occur that would change my mind. All of the main characters had some kind of mental health issue. It did manage to hold my interest and I didn't want to stop reading. It was suspenseful and entertaining."
If the story moved a little faster I would have given it a better score.  The story focuses around an alcoholic with little communication with others until about the middle of the book.  She knows she is an alcoholic with no life but does nothing to make her life better.  She basically sabotages anything positive in her life.  The last part of the book is the best part as that is when the most action occurs.  It's not hard to figure out the ending.  I wouldn't totally write this book off as it was an okay read.  I will admit to skipping some pages as they dragged on going nowhere.
"I can't believe how popular this book is! None of the main characters are likeable or nuanced. The female characters all share the same character flaw which guides their poor choices. Bunch of doormats willing to put up with significant weaknesses in their interpersonal relationships who keep repeating the same self destructive behaviors.  The male characters are self-centered and misogynistic.  Yuck.  The storyline is billed as mystery, but it's not a very iintriguing plot. The ending is not realistic and not satisfying, I guess in large part because by then I disliked the main protagonist so much I just didn't care about her ""happy ending."""
"I also hated this book. It is so boringly repetitive, the plot moves at a glacial pace, but my main complaints are about the writing. If the author chooses to use three narrative voices, there should be at least SOME differences in how they sound. Not here - if you missed the name of the narrator at the beginning of each chapter you are out of luck since not only the voices, but even the content of their tales is pathetically similar. What a waste of time and money! How could this book be on a bestseller list for so long is beyond me. And, by the way, I thought Gone Girl was fine."
When this book was compared to Gone Girl and a Hitchcock like ending I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. The vacuous characters and confusing back and forth time lines made my head spin.  Never could get a grip on what the point was.  Why the hype?
"No spoilers here.I thought the story was decently written and accurately portrayed the issues the characters were facing in the story. However, more character development could have been done, and I think that the shifting narration sometimes detracted from the story. For me, it was not too much of a thriller or very suspenseful. I think some plot points that were supposed to be twists or surprises were spoiled with heavy-handed foreshadowing.In short, it wasn't a bad read, but it was far from the best suspense/thriller novel that I've read."
"This is a book review, not a summary, so I won't simply regurgitate the story here.I hadn't heard the comparisons between Girl on the Train and Gone Girl before I read this novel but I can see some resemblance: both have female leads and both have great plot twists. Other than that, they're completely different. I liked the perspective of seeing things from inside a train and how that narrow focus gradually widened until we could see the whole picture. There were a few obvious red herrings but the suspense was maintained throughout. Also, I think the author nailed the behavior of an alcoholic as well as how such behavior has a ripple effect on everyone else. However, the overall character development -- so important for a good story -- was a little thin (I never got a solid mental picture of anyone), but the pacing was fantastic and the plot twists were well done so that's why I gave it four stars."
"If it ever happens again that I consider a Paula Hawkins book, I pray someone shakes me until I come to my senses.Muddled and exhausting. The ramblings of an alcoholic, schizophrenic, nymphomanic?  The story got too sickening to figure it out.  It is hard to believe that so many people bought this book.I believe the comments by A. Grace hit the tack on the cranium. Wish I had read that before I ordered the book."
"While I enjoy a good murder mystery, I also like to have some compassion for at least one character. The writing was good, hence the two stars but I didn't care about any of the characters especially the main one. The only thing I cared about at the end was the money I spent buying this book. Not one character was remotely likable. I wouldn't purchase another book by this author."
Holds attention and keeps you guessing so you HAVE to know what comes next!
"Although I understand the process of jumping around on time frames in this book it seemed a little more bewildering than some others I have read. In fact for the first hundred pages I really had a hard time getting into the story because Rachel was so pathetic that she was hard to even root for. This does not mean she was not a well-developed character nor does it mean the book was poorly written. I simply had a hard time identifying with any of the characters and it may be because the author was attempting to use Rachel's black periods as a device to make you question what really happened. About two-thirds of the way through the book I had determined who I believed killed Megan so the only thing left to do was to see who lived who died and who went to jail. The finale of the book was well done and feel true to form. I appreciate the story and I always enjoy a mystery but this book did not grab me as much as some others I have read recently. I still think many people would really enjoy reading the book and of course it would make a wonderful movie as has already been done. I simply believe that there are other books that do suspense better than this one although this is a fun read and I cannot say I was disappointed by it. Some of it just felt like it had been done before and in some cases better. As you can see I still believe it was a 4 out of 5 and therefore worth the time to read. Pardon the grammar, it is difficult to write a review on your cell phone."
A few people highly recommended this book so I gave it a try. Found the beginning to be very slow and almost stopped reading it. The story eventually got interesting but I never really cared for the main character. Maybe the story will be turned into an interesting movie but I cannot recommend reading the book.
"I heard a lot about this book so I thought I'd check it out. It was better than I thought it would be. I did figure out who the killer is pretty much before the end, but I was watching pretty carefully for the clues. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I don't expect it to be as good as the book."
I bought this book to see what all the fuss was about.  Now I know.  This is a great book!  Giving you just enough information when you need it as you go along is a great way to keep the reader from becoming bored.  Different view points from different characters.  Very well written.  Twisted story.
"I wanted to like this book, and while it was suspenseful, the plot was highly unrealistic.  While I was reading, I kept telling myself there was no way that something like this would happen in real life.  None of the characters are likeable, which is fine, but the major character shifts in two key characters feel contrived and unconvincing.  The shifting connections between all the main characters are not believable either.  The book's strongest element is its setting, reinforced by Rachel's constant train rides.  I'm not why this book came so highly hyped.  It was OK, but I wouldn't read it again, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
I have NO IDEA why this is #1 on the best seller list. It is OK not great. Read this book if you are on vacation or taking a flight and want a book that won't make you think. It's an easy read. None of the characters make you want to care about them or solve the case.
"This book is full of self-doubt, alcoholism and sadness.  I did NOT enjoy this book - kept reading it so that it may materialize into something happier - it really never did.  I'm sorry I wasted my time.  I was so depressed after reading it.  I mentioned I read it on Facebook and everyone commented how sad it was.  Guess that's what the author had in mind ... so, well ... she achieved that."
"It was well written, but excruciatingly boring. The only excitement I felt was when I was finished. I can't imagine why they would make this book into a movie, that would be a total bore.Besides the very end of the book this wasn't very interesting. None of the characters were likable, in fact I hated them all. Not one favorite. Waste of my time."
"I bought this out of curiosity since it is such a huge bestseller. It is just okay, I fail to see anything special in it. I'm not a huge fan of unreliable narrators for one thing. It makes you wonder if you're just wasting time reading stuff that turns out to be untrue. The protagonist, a slobbering drunk with no respect for others' privacy, is thoroughly unlikable until the ending. The London setting would be intriguing if we got to see more of it, it's mostly train tracks and views from a train window. The supporting cast of characters is thinly drawn. We spend way too much time reading about the protag's drunken stupors, and not enough getting to know anyone else. One has to wonder whether all the glittering blurb-it's actually read it, or were just jumping on the underserved hype train."
"This book was worse than a waste of time. Decided to keep reading this inane story due to my own stubborn tendency not to quit books in the middle. My own fault. The protagonist, Rachel, is a complete wing-nut who happens to also be an alcoholic and consciously makes the wrong decision at every opportunity with or without the aid of alcohol. She is impossible to like and her monotonous internal chatter takes up a lot of the story. Sigh. The book is fraught with maddening ""unrealities"", for instance, Rachel survives financially for days and days on a ""tenner"" that her cliche' enabler flatmate, Cathy, loaned her. Really? The enormous plot twist near the end is the kicker that has me writing this review. It was simply ridiculous. I'm left wondering how this book was ever published in the first place, and who are these people giving 4 & 5 star reviews?"
"For some reason, I was expecting a Gone Girl-style twist in this novel but it was more of a slow build to an increasingly obvious conclusion. It was also kind of like the Lifetime movie of novels - there may be an entertaining storyline, but there's nothing brilliant about it, no real themes or moral to the story, no character development of any significance or depth... It just kind of describes a series of events and tries to thrill the reader a bit. Over all, it was worth reading because it held my attention for a week, but I won't likely sing its praises to anyone or recommend it."
"The story was reasonably interesting at first, but the first person narrative for all three women was sometimes tough to distinguish.  Their voices were too similar.  The author also kind of lost me with Anna; she was just so cold and surprisingly shallow compared to the other two. If she's meant to be that way, that's fine, but really she was unbelievable at times.  The big finish/twist was also wrapped too neatly and too quickly.Overall a mediocre, quick read for a lazy day but it will not be totally satisfying. I wish I had spent my money elsewhere."
"Read this novel and really wanted to love it but I couldn't. It's full of very flawed characters (as is life I suppose) and it's very hard to root for anyone, especially the protagonist. I find it difficult to read a book and feel satisfied when you aren't rooting for anyone. I won't give away any spoilers and I will acknowledge that Rachel ( the protagonist) has had a hard time but at a certain point, you have to rise above your circumstances or the bad hand you've been dealt (don't you?). I'll be interested to see how the movie unfolds as the book is a narrative from the view point of  3 different women. Can't recommend the book."
"Obviously this is a very popular book right now. So it was on my to read list. When I got to the mystery or thriller challenge, I wanted to read this.This is a quick paced, easy to read book.I loved the relationships with Rachel and everyone else.Rachel was flawed and yet I was rooting for her. I wanted her to get it together and have a life and find someone to love her. I wanted her to have a family.Most of the way through the book, I was undecided on who did it. A little more than halfway through, I started thinking it was who it turned out to be. Little clues along the way made me begin to wonder about who it really was.I got a little worried for her safety towards the end.All in all, a fast paced, enjoyable read. A great mystery that will leave you questioning who and what all the way through."
"Great suspenseful book. I couldn't put it down.  I don't usually read fiction books; I'm more of a non-fiction and biography reader.  This book was chosen for a book club that I was a member of, so I figured that I better read it so I could be part of the conversation.  I'm so glad that I did because I had a hard time putting this book down.  When I had to put it down to, I couldn't stop thinking about what was going to happen next.  It was a really well written book with great character development.  I wish the ending was a little different (I kinda saw that coming towards the end of the book)."
"This is dark. And it's depressing. And it's really creepy. The characters all have almost unfathomable problems that make your heart break. But once you start reading Paula Hawkins's ""The Girl on the Train,"" all you will want to do is read.This chilling book--combination psychological thriller and who-done-it--tells the story of three women and two men living in the London suburbs and the love, lies and jealousies that break them. Each chapter is told from the first-person point of view of one of the women. The writing is riveting and the plot compelling, and even when you guess ""who done it,"" there are more twists and turns to come.Advice: Take it to the beach or save it for a snow day when you can just give in and read for hours at a time. It's THAT good."
"Finishing this book became a chore for me about half way through.  The ending was dull and I felt that most of the story didn't tie in much.  There are several narratives, all unlikable.  It tries to be a suspense, but I was bored. You could read the first few and last chapters and not be missing much.  I felt like the author was adding fluff to make a short story into a book.  Honestly I feel like it is super overrated and taking a ride on ""Books similar to Gone Girl"" bus."
"The Girl on the Train: A NovelI enjoyed this book! It is written from each character's perspective, one at a time. It conveys how we can each live out the same scenario, yet perceive the events completely differently. The plot unfolds to keep you guessing as to the truth of the actual events and whose perspective is accurate, if any. Although it wasn't one I couldn't put down, I did find myself wanting to make time to sit down and read. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. If you found this review to be helpful, would you please take a moment to mark it as such. Thanks!"
"I bought this book because people said it was comparable to Gone Girl. It is not. The suspense and buildup are fine but the storytelling is mediocre. Some of the characters were given back stories but these weren't all explained in the story. Gone Girl is so much better than this- the storytelling, the suspense, and the character motives."
"At first I loathed every character. I felt for Rachel experiencing similar events in my life. She made me mad, she made me examine my own life. I've come to understand Rachel and become her champion! I hated Anna, how dare she do what she did? But then you feel for her as a mother, but have a sour taste in your mouth. Oh Megan! I almost feel like we all have a Megan in our lives. You worry for her, judge her, hate her, love her and want to help her. This book hits close to home for me and probably for many more. I couldn't put it down, even when I wanted too."
"This book was selected to be read in my monthly book club. Unlike some book clubs, we actually read the books! I really wanted to like this book but I just found it really difficult to keep the characters straight. I was constantly trying to remind myself who was who and flipping back to previous chapters to make sure I knew which character the author was referring to. This was just not a good book for me. I probably have ADD or ADD tendencies so this book did not help with that at all. I will say that there is a great plot twist at the end - I considered this to be my reward for hanging in there until the end."
"The Girl on the Train was definitely unexpected! The story is told from the points of view of three very different women with one thing in common. None of these three woman are entirely admirable characters. All three have very few redeeming qualities. For the first few chapters it was difficult to feel particularly close to any of them... but it was like driving by a car accident. You know you shouldn't...but you just have to look as you go by.The more I read, the more I had to read on. I subjected anyone who would listen to analyses and theories on who dunnit. Believe me, my accusations evolved rapidly with each turning page... but it wasn't until the last few chapters that the true sinister culprit came forth with clarity and a sense of ""how did I not see this from the start?!""The Girl on the Train was just as, if not more, gripping than Gone Girl."
"Interesting, compelling storyline and definitely held my attention to the end.  The characters and their flaws just kept coming but not in a way that detracted but instead pulled you into the story tighter and tighter.  I must admit to feeling exhausted by the time it ended.I can certainly understand why this book was chosen to become a movie."
The Girl on the Train is a great read.  It took me about a fourth of the way into the story to get into it but once I did I didn't want to put it down.  I started the book on a flight and the return flight just wasn't long enough.  I wanted to keep flying so I could keep reading.  I ended up staying up too late one night to find out how the book would end.  The characters are interesting.  The mood was rather dark.  I like the story told from the viewpoint of each character which seems to be the new trend in writing these days.  I thought I knew how the book would end but I was wrong.  There are lots of twists and turns in the plot and it will keep you guessing. This is the best book I have read in a long time.  When I finished the book I didn't want it to end.  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait for the next book by Paula Hawkins.
"I loved this book, more than I thought I would. Love the multiple narrators with the different perspectives, the swirling revelations that are revealed in an almost rollercoaster fashion. I've missed sleep to read and finish it .that says a lot for me!"
"This sounded good & I had high hopes! It's an ok enough book that it keeps you reading until the end, but it's not a favourite. The main character, Rachel, is so pitiful & self-loathing, it's hard to identify with her. Maybe this is what the author was going for, but I don't think it was done very well. The twist at the end was more disappointing than satisfying. I found the timeline was very difficult to keep track of as it kept bouncing around with each new character chapter - I kept forgetting ""when"" it was & had to go back & check. Overall an ok 1st book to read on my new kindle but not one I'd recommend to someone. Happy I only paid for the kindle edition vs the real book & even then, it's overpriced for what it is. Sorry! Just didn't enjoy it.If you want a good thriller book, try Gone Girl or The Silent Wife - both good reads!"
"""Girl on the Train"" has been on the NY Times bestseller list for so long that I thought it must be a compelling novel.  Wrong.  The premise of the story sounds interesting, but the telling of the story didn't 'grab' me.  Using alcoholic blackouts as a suspense tool was weak, in my opinion.  The main character, Rachel, is so flawed and the situations she finds herself in are just not believable.  Even lab rats learn to alter their behavior with repeated negative stimulus, but not Rachel.  I just couldn't engage with or care about the other characters either.  I usually pass books along to friends, but this one has been sitting on a table for weeks.  I finally realized I don't want to burden anyone else I know with this story, so I'm donating it to a used bookstore."
"At first I thought, oh no, it's Gone Girl set outside of London. That comparison quickly faded as this book is actually better. The flawed main protagonist helps. Actually all the characters are flawed, rendering them both unreliable and sympathetic. This unreliability, drawn up through actual physical reasons for doubt to reasons of lies, emotional distance, and lack of information on a character serves as a constant feed for the tension and its consistent throughout all the diary-like entries.I generally dislike dates as chapter headings. It's just another thing to keep track of and my mind quickly reads over them (hence I forget them straight away) because I hurry right to the ""juicy stuff."" And this book has lots of juicy bits, but the dates ARE important and I made an effort to keep track.5 stars is not quite enough to give this book, I'd say 7-9 was closer out of an imaginary 10."
I started this book a few months ago and put it away. A friend was reading it so I thought I would give it another try. Do not read this book if you're depressed or sad....the whole premise is sick and twisted.  It does depict the sadness and desperation of alcoholism- the total wasting away of someone life. This is not a summer beach read!  I think the author was channeling Gone Girl- no more depressing books for me.
"I thought this would be similar to the Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" but I was wrong. This was a very black and depressing story. The main character was very unlike able and too much of the story was her imagination of events. I had a hard time getting thru the book and eventually decided not to finish reading it. I would not recommend it."
"The characters are under-developed and all seem to have a very similar voice. The use of changing point-of-view just does not really cut it in this book. Each character is fairly flat and about two thrids through the book, I was able to figure out ""who done it."" Or at least ""who probably done it."" I'm still glad I read it, to see what all the buzz is about, and to experience a serious writer's foray into contemporary fiction. This is not great literature; not a terribly deep story, and certainly not on par with Hitchkock thrillers. The writing is straightforward and this is a quick read; almost a page turner. Ok, I admit I turned the page rather quickly. I'd like to add that I'm rooting for Paula Hawkins as a fiction writer, in spite of my tepid review. She is smart and amazing. We will be seeing more great stuff from her."
"Interesting style but used to the point of the story being over-written, over complicated, and self indulgent."
"I couldn't put this one down - I stayed up all night reading this book it was completely engrossing. The characters were FULL of surprises, the plot took many turns, and I genuinely cared what happened to the heroine, even though she is extremely complicated. This was well done and the best thriller I've read since Gone Girl. It's hard for an author to have character this complex be so captivating and likeable, but Paula Hawkins pulled it off. It's like when a movie star is able to play a villain that you both loathe and like. It's tough but fascinating, just like this book!"
"I read this for a book club at work. It's a slow starter, let me just say. The entire set up on the story involves a lot of introspective internal monologue by the main character, drinking on the train and miserable about something, but you don't find out too much for what seemed like the first quarter of the book. It is good at the end and I'm not sorry I read it. The last quarter of story picks up speed, has twists and generally makes up for the slow start.Also, it's not linear. It jumps from the point of view of one female character to the next and then back. It takes a little getting used to, but the characters have a fairly distinct voices, so it gets easier to follow as you go.I chose Dark as the mood for this book, because it is a murder mystery. More along the lines of Gone Girl."
"For a debut novel, you would never know this author had not written before. It is absolutely absorbing, I couldn't put it down.It starts with Rachel riding the train past the house she lived in with her ex who now lives there with his new wife. Also a couple of houses down she observes a loving couple and every day she looks up and watches as the train passes.She makes up names for the loving couple and wonders if she could ever have that kind of love again.This story quickly twists and turns. It is not a romance. Rachel ends up far deeper in the lives of the people in both houses than you expect.I found this book to be gripping and could not wait for the result. This book to me, is book shelf worthy, my only regret is that I purchased it on my kindle. I will watch for this author again. If she could come up with this, what else does she have to tell?"
"I forced myself to read the whole book.  Rachel was a weak baby, and I wanted to shake her and say, ""grow up"".  Talk about blind to anything around her.  Megan was a weak nympho.  It was a book that left you dissatisfied."
"If I had to describe this book in two words, it would be: cheap fiction. The book is mostly written from the perspective of a unreliable, despondent alcoholic mess of a human being. The prose was therefore equally unpolished, lazy, and uninspired. The story itself was somewhat suspenseful -- hence two stars instead of one -- but the resolution unfolds so quickly at the end that it makes you realize that the other 90% of the book was excess junk. Sadly this story could have been told in 30 pages."
"I got confused with the alternating of persons.  I felt like I had to force myself to finish the book.  The end tied everything together with a surprise ending, perhaps the best part of the book.  I bought this book because my daughter wanted to read it because it is on the list of best sellers.  Now that I have finished I told her to be aware that there are 3 different women telling their story and to keep that in mind as you read the book.  Perhaps if I would have been aware of this, I would have rated the book differently.  The women in the story were not ""strong"" women that you would want your daughters to follow as role models.  They each had their issues and in my opinion, set back the way women are viewed and treated."
"This book was very hard to get into as it begins a bit oddly so I put it away to read something else.  Then I saw a trailer for the upcoming movie and I thought that looks good so maybe I will try once more to read the book.  I did go back to it, stuck with it, and once the other characters who narrate the story get involved in telling their side of the story, it all made sense and became a good read to the point that I had to find out who committed the dastardly deed.  I was surprised at the ending.  Stick with it; I think you will be glad you did."
The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a psychological thriller.  Rachael Watson is the Girl on the Train and she is the main character.  Through her train trips we meet the other characters ; Tom (her ex-husband) and his new wife Anna and Scott and Megan.  These two couples are neighbors on the same street.  The first part of the novel rolls along rhythmically like the train on the tracks.  Once the crime has been committed the tension mounts and everyone becomes a suspect.  The mental illnesses run rampant is this novel and everyone seemingly has their own little corner on mental health. The most normal character in the story was Cathy Rachael's roommate.  I found myself comparing this to Gone Girl and The Rear Window.
"Before the end of the book, I had figured out who the killer was, but it had taken me a while.  But even knowing that did not diminish the suspense in this book because I couldn't anticipate how it was going to play out.  I am not going to summarize the plot, but this book was different than anything that I have read, and I read a lot of police procedurals and murder mysteries.  I was intrigued by the blurbs about how the story was about a girl who viewed things from a train; when I am a passenger, I like to look in houses that I am passing and imagine what is happening.  What follows is plausible.  I took me a while to warm up to Rachel, and I can't say that I really liked any of the characters by the end of the novel, but there aren't too many books that I can't wait to get back to.  This was one."
"I like to believe what I read even if it is fiction.  It was hard to believe there could be real people with so much emotional damage as the characters in the novel.  Unfortunately, the nightly news reminds us there are.  The story is like a cork-screw with many twists and turns right up to the final pages which ends like a thrilling movie rather than insightful literature.  However, this seems to be the direction of novels of various genre the last few years which makes me feel some authors are writing with an eye on the big screen.  As a psychological crime novel without an obvious detective and several suspects, it kept me guessing and I rated it as ""good"".  Be careful out there: reality may be stranger than fiction."
"It is both frustrating and enticing to see Rachel's efforts to remember that fateful night. The night she was drunk (again) and a woman disappeared. Rachel meddles with the investigation... sort of... because she liked to watch the woman and her husband from her seat on the London train. Although a couple of houses away live her ex-husband and his new wife and baby, and she kind of stalks them, too. So much sorrow and confusion...I thought the novel was brilliant in depicting an alcoholic's struggle, on top of the ""whodunnit"" story itself. Rachel is both creepy and pitiable. As much of a ""loser hero"" as she was, I found myself rooting for her.My only disappointment came at the end, which was way too drawn-out and gore for my taste. Once we know who's done it, please, wrap it up. Otherwise a really good thriller."
"I've read other excellent reviewers who found the changes in POV and changes in time confusing, but for me they worked quite well.  In fact, the story and the suspense wouldn't have worked without these jumps and I very much liked trying to figure out who thought what when.  All 3 female characters (the 3 POVs) have their perspectives, their differences, and their psychological limitations, so being inside each separately adds to the plots tension.  It's hard to believe that this is a first novel by Paula Hawkins and I look forward to her next.  The Girl on the Train is a fast read and I recommend it highly."
"I'm giving this book one star because of the ending -- which disappoints on so many levels. My method of reading this was a Kindle, so I'd say the book was an absolute fantastic page-turner until about 85%. Then I started getting a picture of how the book would end. I'll deliver no spoilers. Let's just say, by book's end I thought all of the three women principal characters were pretty much idiots. And all so conveniently in the same London neighborhood! Sorry, I don't feel sympathetic towards them. Morever, it's a bit of a male-bashing plot. A bad ending, in my opinion, negates what comes before it.I want my ten hours back!!!!"
"I really enjoyed reading ""The Girl on the Train"".  The characters were interesting to learn about and the story was very different.  I enjoyed seeing life through the eyes of the Rachel and the other main characters.  Rachel made me feel what she was feeling and I was interested to see what happens next.  The book was shocking, but thrilling to read.  I like that the author tells the story from more than one perspective, but the main focus is on Rachel. I got to understand her better as the book went on and you can't help but feel pity for her when you learn why she ended up a binge drinker.  I like the way she sees life through the window of the train.  I can relate to how she felt.  The book was a page turner from beginning to end and it was well written. I would recommend it because I enjoyed it and it was also a unique story."
"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is told from the first person point of view by Rachel, who imagines fantasy lives for people living in homes that she passes on the train. Living a restricted life, her daily train rides disguise that she has been fired from her job. As a heroine, Rachel is not particularly likeable. She has low self-esteem and is frequently so drunk that she has memory lapses, with one such lapse serving as a primary focal point.  Personally, the constant inebriation was overdone. Other characters, particularly the male ones, are similarly unlikeable. And when Rachel injects herself into the lives of those who had been fantasy characters, it's a bit much to accept. No doubt, this novel has become popular because of Ms. Hawkins' skill at slowly unraveling the many layers of this novel's central mystery: What happened to Megan?"
I ordered the book for a friend and took it out of the library for my self.  My friend loves mysterys.  I had a hard time getting trough it.  I don't know why it is on best seller lists.  I returned the book for her and another I ordered from Amazon called Headstrong.  She had a PHD in biochemistry.
"I'm usually not into thrillers. I lean more towards historical fiction but I couldn't put this one down! At first I bought just the Kindle version but I soon added the audio version for my car. It is very well-written. Even though several women are narrating at different times, it is easy to follow along and know who is speaking. This is especially important on the audio version. I was never confused about who was narrating. I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie (which is also good but in a different way)."
"I read the whole thing because it was my book club's monthly choice.  The first negative is that the names and characters were very confusing and difficult to keep track of who's who.  This clarified after the first several chapters.  The second negative is that I didn't like the main character at all.  She was such a wimp and complainer!  I don't like being around negative, complaining people, so reading a book full of ""poor me"" was not fun or entertaining.  I also figured out ""who done it"" rather quickly, so it wasn't much of a thriller.  The writing was average, so I didn't have to suffer through poor sentence structure or grammatical errors.  I wish I had borrowed it from the library rather than spending money on it.  I deleted it from my tablet immediately after the book club meeting."
"The book was recommended to me by a respected friend.I feel I should have downloaded the sample first.I found the author's style to be repetitious and confusing as the principle in the book started off by deceitful behaviour in order to conceal that she no longer was employed, but continued to a daily routine involving the train to and from her point of previous employment.She then continued her downward spiral through a series of actions involving what amounted to voyeurism, then alcohol dependency, to infidelity and finally involvement in a murder.This is not the kind of book that I would endorse."
"If you are looking for a page-turner of a mystery, this is for you.  The protagonist, Rachel, has plenty of problems- out of work, divorced and alcoholic- and she rides a train every day to keep up the appearance that she has a job for her room mate, Cathy.  She watches a couple she does not know every day but sees their happiness and longs to experience the happiness she once knew.  But then the woman she watches disappears after a night where she was drunk and in the area and she cannot remember what happened.  The list of suspects grows and you can not be sure what happened as the layers of the characters are peeled back, one by one.  This is an intense psychological thriller that will keep you turning the pages for more."
"At this moment in time newbie authors are trying to jump on the bandwagon so they can get ""The Next Gone Girl"" blurb on their book cover. (While I loathed Gone Girl and wished every character to die die die, I would be a fool not to acknowledge the success of the book.)  Paula Hawkins' novel is the story of two hot messes and how their lives intersect even though technically they never meet. Well, lets be honest: everyone in this book is a hot mess and even after the climax of the story I believe they will continue on their individual downward spirals. But I was more entertained, was more interested in how everything would be resolved, and had a better time reading this Girl than I did That Which Shall Be Forgotten."
"With all the hype 'The Girl on the Train' had been getting, I wasn't quite sure if it would be something I'd enjoy. Generally I tend to steer away from huge blockbuster books as they are a little more ""safe"" than what I usually enjoy reading. Lucky for me, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, and was sucked into this book from the very beginning. One of the best ""page-turner"" thrillers I've read in quite some time, 'The Girl on the Train' is a fantastic psychological work. Not only a thrilling read, but also a smart one that makes you question how much you might really know about someone - even after you think you know it all."
"I read The Girl on the Train in one weekend after seeing a preview of the upcoming movie. It looked intriguing so I bought it. The character development is good but not too much to bore you and the story moves quickly. There are definitely some twists and turns as the plot is told through the perspectives of three different women, but I was able to figure out ""who done it"" about a third of the way into the book. That didn't completely ruin it for me because I still wanted to see how things would play out in the end. It's not serious reading but it is entertaining."
"I found this book tedious in the extreme.  Not fast-paced, not a thriller.  The characters weren't relatable, they were boring.  The alcoholism was grating, and far too repetitively convenient as a plot point.  I'm giving it two stars because the writing was decent -- not compelling, but Ms. Hawkins knows how to put sentences together and has a decent command of grammar, a skill not shared by a lot of current authors.  Her plotting is another matter. The overall plot wasn't bad, but along the lines of what another reviewer wrote, instead of putting the effort required into writing a truly engaging story with unfolding events, the author just had her narrators withhold detail so she could have a series of plot twists.  I knew who the killer was halfway through the book.  The final twist was the most satisfying, but it was an effort to finish the book to get to it."
"I've never wanted to bitch slap a story character so badly and i don't believe in violence.  I was rooting for Rachel but she was a hot mess.  Is it possible for a person to be that herp derp?  I cringed at her repeated socially awkward behavior and situations she put herself in.  Yes we have all been fools for love but Rachel groveled to new depths.  I am not familar with severe alcoholism but her constant blackouts became annoying.  I was hoping Rachel would adopt some real detective skills and her mission would inspire her to grow a spine but that never materialized.  The foundation of the story is enticing and I kept thinking any minute it was going to kick into overdrive, instead the book stayed in third grear grinding to a petered out finale."
"I got this book to satisfy my need for another Gone Girl –type of thriller to read with my mother this summer. This fit the bill.  I’m usually the type of person who can’t predict an ending in a mystery and I’m almost always surprised with where it goes. Not so with this book. The plot is not too complicated, so it’s perfect for laid-back summer brain where you might not be completely engaged every time you pick up the book. Prepare yourself for a main character that you will not like. This makes the story itself shine more than the main character, which is a very interesting. Also, the main idea of the story – witnessing something on a train and then inserting oneself into the drama is a great premise. Overall, a good book and a great summer read."
"If you like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and other psychological thrillers in that genre, then you'll probably love The Girl on the Train. This is an excellent and superbly written book, amazing for a first novel.But I didn't particularly like Rear Window (more boring than suspenseful, I thought), and I found it a bit hard to get through this book for the same reasons. Despite excellent writing and a great story, it moved so glacially slowly that I got bored and disinterested. Personally I'm more a fan of action thrillers, and this just had too many long stretches of nothing.Still, it's a great book for those that like long-simmering suspense; so I rate it as 4 stars as a compromise between 5-star writing and 3-star interest for me."
"I started reading this book on an airplane; LaGuardia to El Paso. I was 80 percent finished by the time I arrived in Texas. I could not put it down. I vaguely recall airline crew talking to me: In case ofemergency...do you want something to drink...etc. I, however, was not flying on a plane but was instead, riding in a train. Thank you for this addicting read."
"Did not like this book. Best seller?  Felt kind of duped or suckered.  Found the pace dull, slow and many of the points repeated over and over.  Not really suspenseful, with an end set of events that held no surprise.  Reading a book were I do not like any of the characters and find their motivations so shallow and petty is not fun, enlightening or a good read.  Don't get me wrong, characters need flaws and personality complexity to bring a story to life.  But to paraphrase Dean Wormser ""Son, fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life.""  It does not make a good main character either."
"This book reminded me of the classic ""Rebecca"" with the irreliable narration and tormented protagonist, except honestly this story was a bit more of a page turner, but this is mostly due to a style of writing more suited to a modern audience.If you are someone who has suffered abuse or suffer depression, this book is likely to be a trigger and may have a bad effect on you. Most reviewers don't think of such things.This was a very good book and I highly recommend it, I'm not one to go on analyzing a book. Let just say it will have an emotion impact on you. If you like your protagonists to be loveable and larger than life, you won't like this book, it is dark and perhaps just a little to ""real."" I see it compared to ""Gone Girl, and I get the similarity, this one requires much less suspension of disbelief."
"The previous reviewers who remarked that the voices of the three narrators/women were wholly interchangeable hit the proverbial nail on the head! That and the fact that there was no real nuance or dimension to any of the characters to begin with are the biggest disappointments about this novel. Maybe the latter is the reason there were no real distinguishing features between any of them other than their circumstances so it is really the same problem. And the characters were not believable or likable. I did, however, from time to time find myself rooting for Rachel despite her propensity for excessive apologizing and her pathetic behavior and life, and I found the story/plot itself was still a relatively engaging whodunit so I gave it three stars overall. Just don't expect it to move you in any way.  Profound this novel is not."
"This was one of those books that is hard to review. All of the characters were horrible people, not a likable person in the bunch. But yet there were times I could not put it down, wondering what would  happen next.  Would I recommend it?  I'm not sure. It was different, but somewhat akin to Gone Girl. If you read that book, you will know what I mean about unlikable characters. A bit of a ""train wreck"" pun intended, several bad marriages, a drunk you just want to slap sometimes, mental abuse, it's got all that! If you like dysfunctional people, this book might just be for you."
"Great suspense story, slightly better than the movie.  It is now a movie which I found a little confusing on the characters.  I believe the book helps clarify the ambigusness."
"Yet another version of an inexplicably popular genre: poorly written books about awful people who do awful things to each other because they're too shallow and too bored to think of anything better to do with their time. Girl on the Train, Gold Finch, Gone Girl, Go Set a Watchman. Why do all these train wrecks start with the letter G? Not because they're good or worth your time to read. Why these books are sometimes grouped with Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See is beyond me, since Doerr always writes beautifully about worthwhile people and subjects. Kindle keeps recommending books like this for me, I guess because I keep reading them. Addicting, like the booze their protagonists often over consume. No worries, though. Tomorrow I'm going to quit."
"I enjoyed this book because it brought to mind things I've thought about while looking out of a train window while going to school overseas for two years.  The route was the same twice daily so I saw the same buildings and  people and wondered about their lives.  It's the same  familiarity with a neighborhood you get if you walk a dog along the same path.  You start to make assumptions about the people you see, imagine their life stories,weave scenarios in your mind, and then find out the rich people in the mansion can't afford furniture, the slender woman is bulimic, and the pleasant man kicks his dog.  This is a really good premise for a story.  I wish I hadn't realized quite early who would actually have done what, but I've read a lot of mysteries.  This book had believable and interesting characters. It was all in all a very good read."
"I loved this book and read it in about 3 days.  I thought the characters were compelling, albeit self-absorbed and difficult to like at times. I was drawn in by the first few paragraphs and how sad and dejected Rachel was, but I kept going because I really wanted to figure out what happened to Megan and to see if Rachel finds some peace.  The only flaw with this novel, in my opinion, is the 3 main characters' preoccupation with husbands, babies, and reproduction.  All of their lives, and personalities, revolve around men and babies, and they all seemed in competition with each other over who has the most idyllic family life.  It struck me as an archaic, artificial basis for their actions, which gave the whole novel an almost sexist feel to it.  Having said that, the novel is entertaining and seductive and I would definitely recommend it."
"The Girl on the trainI was a little confused at the beginning of this intriguing story, but once I was able to identify each individual character the way the author had intended to portray them I was on a roll.As the story begins to unfold and the secrets,  lies and deceptions come to light through this well written storyline it became impossible to put the book down.I was totally captured in the whole thrilling,  captivating suspense, the twists turns right to the very end, and once you begin to understand each individual character you will then be totally hooked as the story unfolds and the killer is revealed.Definitely worth the read.Loved it Paula, nice work."
"You NEED to read this before the movie comes out.  The pace is steady; page after page the story develops until you get to the top and realize that what you thought about a character was completely off.  Truly well written.  I'm a suspense kind of gal, so I'm a fan of Paula Hawkins.  I'm looking forward to the movie yet still always believe that the books are better than the movies.  You cannot capture thoughts, emotions, and scenes in movies as well as you can within your own imagination.  I will not give details into the plot.  You must simply read it."
"So glad these women didn't continue as pathetic victims. The unfolding of truth was well done. Anna was triumphant mad creepy at same time. She might be the character I would most likely to see if cashed in movie. Megan was so well scripted out... Sounded borderline personality or bipolar. Well done. The doctor ... Story of her past had so much potential for a thriller in itself. Great characters ... Lushes, cheats, narcissists. I didn't feel sorry for people too long which was a nice reprieve. Everyone was good and evil; except baby. Not sure if murderer was anything but a pathological liar gone socio path. Not a lot of good underneath it all. Liked it very much. Will miss no one though. Never want to see anyone again because it would be a nightmare that you would want to wake up from. Scary women.  Scary men. Evie has a legacy now."
"Good opening, entices the reader into the story.  The three person narratives at times became confusing, especially if the reader put down the book and did not read it straight through, since there certain similarities in the character's traits. The author made good use of an ordinary circumstance of daily train riding to bring home a lot of good points.  The train is a metaphor for the lives of the three women in varying stages of decision making; Rachel caught in between life and destruction, Anna craving to move and Meghan who actually does make a move. I found their stories so intertwined for a while I thought they might be one woman with three personalities. I found the ending justified and was glad the author indicated the forward movement of the remaining characters. A good, light summer read."
"This book is so easy to read that before I knew it I had read for hours!! I wanted to gobble it down as fast as I could. The main character is an emotional mess and it can feel depressing in places, but keep reading! Written as stream of consciousness, you learn plenty about the characters consistently throughout the book.  There is a lot to know and the story opens like a rose, revealing the confusion, tension and mystery of the plot. It keeps you guessing who the victim will be, and then who the murderer is! Terrific ending!!"
"I loved this book from start to finish.  And I also loved how it was written - in the ""First Person"", but by three different people, but also each narrator follows a slightly different timeline.  The main narrator is Rachel with Megan also narrating a good part of the book and finally Anna who plays just a minor role in the narration.  Megan's story is a few weeks behind Rachel's.The story is excellent with a great twist at the end.  It is very well written and the characters, who you get to know in a very gradual way, are very believable.  The story, and writing style, gripped me from the very beginning and kept my interest right up to the end.If this is Paula Hawkins' first book then I cannot wait for her second one."
"The story was told in somewhat confusing narration. It was very hard to care for the main character and about three quarters into the plot, it was clear who was the killer. It was very hard to care for the people, they seem flat and one dimensional. The writing was OK, but lacked the ability to grab your attention fully as it was jumping from person to person with no seeming connection and the story felt like it was not developed with neither."
I could not put this book down once I started. (I read it in a few days -- that's how good it is!) It is full of twists and turns. I love that each chapter is narrated by a different character. It was a bit of an easy read for me but still kept me on the edge of my seat. Every chapter I would change my mind on who I thought the killer was.I would definitely recommend to those that love a good thriller. Can't wait for the movie!
"It's no ""War and Peace"" but The Girl on the Train was perfect for me to read on a long trip.  The plot offers some insight on how much anyone can really know about another person, especially if there are drugs and alcohol involved.  The heroine, who is battling her own demons, observes certain behaviours and comes to conclusions about them.  The truth is not always as simple as it seems, however, and jumping to conclusions without knowing the whole story is never a good idea.  The book is about how she finally makes sense of nonsense."
"I really wanted to love this book.  The premise was so intriguing....girl riding on the train inventing lives for the occupants of the houses she passes every day.  As the story unfolds about the girl on the trains past relationship with these houses I felt a little set up.  Some of the twists were true twists and the identity of the ""bad guy"" was initially surprising.  If this book had ended differently I would have had a better reading experience but it stepped into a very unbelievable set of behaviors that sapped the energy from the book.  The Girl on the Trains character was not as developed as it could have been.  I did enjoy the different voices the story was told from as we got to know more about the characters."
"I don't understand how this could be compared to Gone Girl.  ALL of the characters were unlikable, the story dragged on, and the ending was predictable. Don't waste your time. I gave it two stars only because I actually finished the book."
"This was highly touted and I did like it, listening to the Audible version on my morning walks. It was well narrated. At first it was hard to care about this young woman who had totally lost her sense of self respect and was basically a desperate drunk. But as the story unfolded and she observes a couple in the house down the street from where she used to live, she fantasizes about their life as she fakes going to work on the train to the city. She is living with a friend since her husband left her but doesn't want her to know she has lost her job.I was involved in the characters and felt sorry for this pathetic woman who can't seem to face reality and get her life together. I would recommend book. It does twist toward the end."
"The main character constantly enters into situations with no plan about what she is going to say or do.  It was very tiring reading over and over again, ""I know I shouldn't do this, but...."" and off she goes.  It was sad reading about someone with no self esteem and always so drunk she couldn't remember what she had done."
"It's hard to argue with the success of this book--millions of copies sold in several languages, a movie deal, and almost 44K Amazon reviews, so far. The story kept me hooked, and the author's storytelling was fresh and original, with characters whose personalities were revealed a layer at a time. I will say the pacing dragged a bit in the beginning, but once the story got going, I continued to read until the end. I felt empathy for the flawed protagonist, Rachel, who has been beaten down by life and finds it hard to cope. Not everyone finds life easy to navigate, and I rooted for Rachel to the last page."
"This story of The Girl on the Train is on suspenseful and adventurous ride. Turning this way, then that way; Hills and valleys. You think you have the perfect glimpse of a suspect only to be thwarted by another dark tunnel or turn. The perfect mystery."
"If Eric Bentley was right, and melodrama is fueled by the amount of fear it generates, then this is a successful melodrama. These women are all but literally tied to the train tracks in their shared London neighborhood. Their relationships are sharply rendered but shallow; there is betrayal, hand-wringing, abandonment, posturing villainy, and pathological obsession with all things superficial--body shape, real estate, reproductive success, chemical vice, and sexual virtue. Infidelity and sexual adventurism remain punishable by death (for women only). This story's twists and characterizations are so broad and archetypical that it could be told in pantomime. Luckily for us, it's told in really excellent prose; Paula Hawkins has a lot of fun with this problematic potboiler, and so did I."
"Many have compared this novel favorably to ""Gone Girl"" and I can see why - both share an unreliable narration (three narrators in total) and unreliable spouses, too. Key details are effortlessly omitted until they play a major role in the ending (e.g., certain facts that were never explained turn out to be very important). While the novel starts a bit slowly, the second half moves along much better as the story is tighter and increasingly suspenseful.Hawkins' writing is terrific - almost cinematic - and her portrayal of the sad alcoholic Rachel Watson is, as Stephen King tweeted, ""dead perfect.""A recommended read."
"I had previously read ""Gone Girl"" as a book recommended to me by a friend.  Liked the book but didn't think it was anything ""great"".  The Girl On the Train is great!!  Admittedly, I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to books.  I have ""divorced"" more than one book before reading even twenty pages - live is too short and there are too many truly good books to read.  An interesting and unpredictable plot is no longer enough to satisfy me as a reader.  I need smart writing and, frankly, a vocabulary that challenges me without being tedious.  The Girl On the Train is all of that and more - suspenseful with a unique storyline and human.  I have given it my highest endorsement - recommending it to my friends.  Waiting to hear more from you, Paula Hawkins."
I purchased this book for a book club I joined and needless to say I finished it before the set date we were to discuss it. This story kept my attention from beginning to end. I loved how the story is told from the three women perspectives so you gain a full understanding of how they are connected. For a while I had a couple people in mind as the murders when I got closer to the end and realized neither of the people I suspected to be the murderer I was quite surprised. I read a couple reviews stating that they expected the story to end the way it did but I beg to differ. I didn't feel like this was a typical story of love and betrayal. If you do decide to read this book I honestly don't think you will be disappointed because I certainly wasn't.
"I read this right on the heels of another multiple-perspective suspense novel.  While the first one felt very flat, this story seemed to pop to life from the very beginning, and while the characters in the other book were boring, these were interesting.  Just when you think you knew something about them, they were still able to pull off a surprise or two.  While the overall tone is not comedic, there were occasional moments that made me laugh out loud.  I enjoyed getting into their minds.  The other thing I enjoyed about this book is that I could really visualize very vividly what was going on, and I kept feeling like this could easily be adapted as a film.  I look forward to reading more from Paula Hawkins!"
"The story compelled me into reading at any interval I could justify so that I could get to the end.  It dragged for me in the very beginning with the extensive description of Rachel's alcoholic behaviors.  It did set it up well, however, for the way through the rest of the story.It is a good psycho-thriller."
At first I found the book a bit difficult to follow because it jumped from character to character and dates kept changing with the change of characters. I quickly realized I had to pay attention to which character and what the date was when going to a new chapter.  But I found the book intriguing from the first page. I couldn't put it down. Well written - - a great mystery.
I started reading this book a few years back and I left it on the 3 or 4th chapter. When I saw that they made a movie of it. I decided to give it another try. I immediately remembered why I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to unveil the secret and get to the bottom of everything. The book leads you one way and then it takes you another. Buy what I found most profound is the description of alcoholism and what people really go through. I really felt dizzy and frustrated and angry and Rachel at times. It was a very good book and I can't wait for the movie!
This is just not my kind of book.  I prefer they Clancy type books. However with ll the hope and the new movie I thought. I would raid it.  A long story abut crazy chicks is not for me.  I figured our who killed Megan about mid-way though the book.  It droned on and on until the last few chapters.
"At first this book was confusing as could be.  I finally figured out that the author is jumping from two different characters - both written in First Person.  Then I re-started the book.  And as it progressed, a third character was also added - written in First Person.It is a great story - had me guessing right up to the very end."
"<<possible spoiler-ish info, so use caution>>Paula Hawkins' debut novel hooks you pretty quickly.Rachel Watson takes the same train to and from her suburban London home every day. She has grown accustomed to the people on the train, and the things the train passes along its route, especially a set of houses set back from the tracks. Most days the train stops at a signal which allows her to observe the people in those houses, and she imagines they are living happier lives than she is. She often sees one attractive couple, whom she's named Jason and Jess, and she's invented careers for them, and feels so good about their relationship.One day, what she sees from her seat on the train shocks her. ""Jess"" is kissing another man! How could she jeopardize the perfect relationship that she and ""Jason"" have? Rachel is devastated and angry, since her own life is in a shambles, and she has idealized this couple she doesn't know. And when ""Jess,"" whose real name is Megan, disappears the next day, Rachel is shocked—and feels that she needs to tell the police what she saw. Little by little, she gets more involved in the investigation about what happened to Megan, because she wants to do her part, and she feels that she knows something.The thing is, though, Rachel isn't entirely reliable. She has a bit of a drinking problem—well, a big drinking problem. And sometimes she has trouble remembering what happens when she drinks. But she has this feeling she might have seen what happened to Megan. If only she could remember...""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""The Girl on the Train is the story of a woman who feels as if life has tossed her out, and she cannot regain her momentum. She is desperate to feel needed, to feel wanted, included again, so when she sees an opportunity to try and help out with the investigation into Megan's disappearance she jumps at the chance. But she doesn't count on her own lies and inadequacies being revealed, or being forced to confront her own issues.Hawkins is a terrific writer and has written a taut, compelling book, despite the fact that many of its characters are pretty unlikeable. The book is told from multiple perspectives—Rachel, Megan, and Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. I found my mind spinning with all of the different possibilities of what happened, and what was going to happen. I came up with outlandish theories, theories that seemed they had merit, and one I hoped wouldn't be the case.Then sadly, in my mind, Hawkins punted. She took the easy way out, and it honestly killed the book for me. I don't think I'm smarter than many people, although I guess I read a lot of thrillers, but I totally saw the ending coming. I was truly disappointed.I'd definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions. So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety, and been shocked by the way everything transpires, so perhaps you will as well. I think for the most part, this is a pretty great book, and I look forward to seeing what comes next in Hawkins' career."
"Truly, one of the worst books I've read in years. Though it tries to be suspenseful, it is simply chaotic – yet fashionably predictable. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure the film will be different, but I simply cannot recommend this book. It took a lot of will to finish it."
This is what you call a true novel. I loved the way the writer took time to build up the scenes. The writer also used the pen with the plot to make you think as well as talking about more in each scene. The writer makes you feel like you are in the scene and in the mind of the character.
"I got 60% of the way through the book and had to look up the ending on Wikipedia because I couldn't read anymore. The characters are incredibly unlikeable. Rachel, the main narrator makes terrible dicisions again and again even though she is fully aware that they terrible. 90% of what I read was Rachel being drunk when she was trying to be sober and harassing people."
"Well written novel about a neighborhood in the London suburbs near a train where a murder takes place, and how the murderer is in plain sight, but not discovered until the end of the story.  The story is told from 3 different women's perspectives, even the one who is eventually murdered."
"The early reviews were right. Pick this thriller up and be prepared to plunge into its world of overlapping characters, well-placed red herrings and enough female angst to fill a shrink's office. Paula Hawkins' complex thriller is the book ""Gone Girl"" wanted to be but wasn't. (Sorry  ""Gone Girl"" fans.) Its heroine's alcohol addiction fuels her obsession with a house she passes daily on a train commute to London. Hawkins never quite lets us know if someone is heading for harm or salvation, and the imbalance is thrilling. Divided among three female characters, the chapters take the reader to the edge of one of two things - a purging reality or the embrace of unspeakable danger. Un-put-downable."
"A real ""who done it"" story. The author draws you into each of the woman's lives then twist and turns them around. Not sure who is responsible for the outcome of the story, all lives interact with one another. Because this happened then this happens but wait.... Because what was witnessed while on the train rolling past..... All intertwined. This is a very good murder mystery book.I probably should give this a five star but I hated the gruesome ending. It was the right ending....I just don't like violence.  I usually stay away from murder mysteries but it was our book club pick for the month. I am glad we picked it.I don't think I will ever get drunk ( not that I ever have but I will never contemplate it now) after reading this one!"
"Took me about a day of reading to get through, and not that i expected the ending exactly  just due to the cues not being very present but i knew something big was going to shift. I feel like the book should have been two in a series because the cast completely shifted in the last chapters.I will say that it was evoking how accurate Rachel's narriations on alcoholism were.Won't be reading again but probably will go see the movie soon, but not on opening weekend to avoid the seburban housewives who read this in their book club."
"Every book today is compared to Gone Girl. Its the New Gone Girl,the Newer Gone Girl,  the Newest Gone Girl. So for those of you expecting a Gone Girl Repeat, this book will disappoint you.  I for one did not love Gone Girl.  However, as The Girl on the Train has amassed 10,000 plus reviews on Amazon, it has just as much hype as Gone Girl.  Train's premise is fun especially for those of us who enjoy peering in people's houses  and lives unobserved from the window of a train or car but  the execution is amateur. Still it is a compelling read.  Rachel is a fun character, a total loser who has kind of accepted her rejected, drunken status and doesn't seem to get to rattled about anything.  Won't take too much figuring out to guess who the killer is in this book but all the same, its a pleasant way to pass a few hours."
"While this was a  most interesting and entertaining book, and It occupied my thoughts when I put it down, I find I can not give it the four or five stars it would otherwise get from me because the voices of the three main women were too similar. I often had to refer to the name at the beginning of the chapter to see who it was about, or read deeply enough into the story to get the gist. There were no individual telltale words or patterns of expression to tell which one the chapter was supposedly written by. Voice is the only major problem I see."
"There's a good reason this is coming out in movie format.  It's GREAT!  Kind of made me feel engrossed in the same way ""Gone Girl"" did.  I had to keep checking the time line to keep things straight in my head.  I'll be interested to see how the movie works with that.  Let your imagination take you through the visuals your mind creates before watching Emily Blunt create a whole different picture.  I'm sure the buzz about the movie is right and this will be a winner.  How could it not be with that woman acting the starring role in a story this dark?"
"I love to read a book before hi see a movie when I can.  You know the book is always better, but I actually look forward to the changes.  Seeing how they pictured the characters compared to me.I think it took a little while for the book to pick up and for me to get use to the back and forth between characters, but by the end I was looking forward to the end of one person's point of view so I could read the others and compare.I like that I didn't put it all together early on.  I was surprised when I knew who did it."
"I read this book in a couple of days and enjoyed it.  I thought it was well written and I liked how each chapter was from a different character's point of view.  None of the characters were that likable, but then, who is?  :)But seriously, the main character was weak and did some pretty foolish things.  However, this made her interesting and you never knew what she was going to do next.  I do wish that she'd ended up being stronger after all she'd gone through, but she was still running away from things and afraid in the end.  I'd recommend this book as a fun, suspenseful and easy read."
"Ugh. This book reminded me so much of Gone Girl. I think I'm one of the only people I know that hasn't liked either. Both of them I did finish because I wanted to know how they ended. This book was a little more satisfying at the end, but not by much. I found myself not LIKING any of the characters. I couldn't pull for anyone, because they were all so unlikable. In the beginning, the main character makes up stories about strangers she sees regularly. Who with an imagination hasn't done that? After that, the story becomes rather far fetched. If you're bored and need something to read because you've read all the books by your favorite authors, then try this. Otherwise, there are many better bets out there. I just finished What She Left Behind. Loved that!"
"Sure the plot devices of this novel are a little silly and far-fetched. Sure the main character gets asked to specific locations because the story requires it in order for the plot to continue. Sure the ending deserves a couple of eye-rolls.But who cares? The central mystery of the novel is compelling enough to make you HAVE to know how it ends. I read the entire book in a day and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read FOR FUN.Haters gonna hate, but this book has more mystery and suspense that 99% of basically everything else."
"This is a really interesting and well-written novel.It portrays a troubled alcoholic woman whose booze-induced actions and resulting amnesia are manipulated by other characters. The story centers around the disappearance of a young woman and the interaction among the protagonist, her ex and his wife, and the down-the-street neighbors. Much of the story occurs on the street adjacent to the rail tracks viewed from a train that the ""girl"" frequently travels.The carefully-timed character development perfectly allows the story to unfold and the suspense to build. The story is told from several characters' perspective adding to the plot and the personalities. The author's detailed picture of the personalities and the telling of the story my several main characters sets apart this murder mystery from most others."
"This book is absolutely riveting. It is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time. The writing drew me in from the very first page and I could hardly put the book down after that. Anyone who likes books by Tess Gerritsen will love this book. I liked the character of Rachel, even though she could be so exasperating. While the other characters were a bit less likeable, I could emphasize with them. The ending was a surprise to me, which was nice. I don't like to figure out "" who dunnit"" halfway through the book. I cannot speak to the comparison to Gone Girl. I saw the movie and thought it was just awful, so I never read the book. I highly recommend The Girl on the Train, and do look forward to the movie."
"There are 5 main characters in the story and in each chapter, one of them is telling the events through their eyes - and so you have to remember the names and the dates are not consecutive, but jump back and then move to the present in the next chapter - her style of writing is a bit challenging; however, as the mystery unwinds, the suspenseful mystery builds and it gets harder and harder to put down.  The story starts out from the perspective of the girl on the train, who looks through the window and on the porch, watching glimpses of this couple, as the train makes a daily stop across from their house.  The story picks up the pace and pretty soon you will not be able to put it down.  There were a few graphical errors which made me go back and reread a few sentences, but it didn't detract from the story.  A great ride."
"At first I wasn't sure I'd like the book, as it started quite slowly and almost burdensome at times. But I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did! As the author gave us more details about each character, she started weaving the web that eventually trapped me and I was hopelessly and deliciously entangled. As she fed more and more details, the story took many right and left turns, and each time I thought I'd solved the mystery another detail was leaked and I found I was completely wrong. I could not help but finish the shocking climax in one sitting, each event unfolding at just the right place, finishing with the most unlikely heroine saving the day. Get and read this book - and be prepared for good ride. All aboard!"
"I had anticipated a bit more writing talent, this was an okay story, one good enough to not put down without finishing but, on the other hand, had I lost it or not finished it I would not have cared.Made out to be much more suspenseful than I found it to be and the details a bit outlandish, like trying to fit jigsaw puzzle pieces into a puzzle where they truly don't fit and say "" there, that's good enough"".Read it if there's nothing better around but I would not pay for it.  Just okay."
"This book starts to engage you from the beginning.  I had not read the book when it first came out, but thought I should when I became aware that a movie was being made with one of my favorite actresses, Emily Blunt.  I enjoyed the pity, irritation, and fondness I had for the main character.  Sometimes she was hard to like, but the author kept me stringing along.  I won't write more because I hate when someone writes a spoiler.  If you haven't yet read this book read it now it is truly a great story that is well written in a great style!"
"At first, it was difficult to get into the story. A bit confusing and a lot of back and forth between characters and dates. Fortunately, for me, there were only three character's point of view. I finished the book in three days. The first day was arduous, but once I started again, the second day, it was almost challenging to put the book down. Finally, on the third day, I couldn't stop until I finished it. Surprising twist at the end and at times I suspected it could be..., but then thwarted the idea of it being so. Definitely a great, suspenseful read."
"Much hype about this book.  The interaction of all the characters was improbable. While it is fiction and a snapshot of a time in space, none of the characters were particularly likable or realistic.  Hard to find much empathy for or identification with any of them. I know alcoholics with some of the devastating results experienced by Rachel.  Not sure people ""recover"" their memory or black-outs as quickly and clearly as Rachel.  But it would be a very long book if in the real world. The two babies in the book, one living, one deceased, were the ones for whom I felt anything except vague annoyance.  Imagine attempting to navigate such a self-absorbed adult world.  While the book moved quickly, ultimately I was disappointed."
"""The Girl on the Train"" is a voyeuristic, cleverly plotted thrill ride.  Paula Hawkins is a first-time novelist.  She's a writer and editor by profession though, so 'Train' is no flying blind leap into a new career.  The writing and plotting here is ingenious and first rate.Were someone to tell you about the literary device employed here --- three first-person voices, alternating by paragraph, over different time periods -- you might think, jeez, that sounds hard to follow.  It's not. You pick up on it right away and get immediately into the flow.You can almost see the cinema version of the book in your mind's eye as you blitz through it.  So, no surprise then to read that Dreamworks preemptively acquired the rights to Hawkins' work late last year."
"I was so disappointed in this book.  The characters were sad to read about and the plot line was horrible.  I would not call this a ""thriller.""  It was more a sad commentary about self destructive behavior."
"I usually don't read these kinds of books, I think mostly meant for women.  But, once I got into the story and the twists and turns, I could not put it down.  I too wondered all along who the culprit might have been, and was somewhat surprised when I learned it all near the end of the book.  Although an interesting presentation, the chapters for a particular character need not have been identified as ""Morning"", ""Noon"" and ""Night"".  Somewhat different for sure, but a little irritating that was not necessary for the reader.  Excellent description of the neighborhoods outside London, and the train service which is also very good.  I have used it myself, on a holiday.  Easy to get around for sure.  So keep up the good writing and let us see what's out there soon."
"yuck!  I just disliked this book so much.  it seemed like a real take-off of 'gone girl' in some places and at times it felt as if some of the episodes were lifted directly from that book.  at any rate, I did finish it but am now looking to give it away to anyone I can since I don't plan on making it part of my permanent library."
"This book was recommended to me by a friend.  It's not the type of book that I normally choose.  When I first started reading, I wasn't quite sure that I was going to like it.  Rachel, the main character, was somewhat annoying to me (and this feeling lasting throughout most of the book).  It was also a little confusing switching back and forth between characters.  However, after a few chapters, I was hooked.  The author had a way of describing the characters that made you feel like you knew them.  Although it did take me a little while to really get into the story, before long it was hard to put down.  It is very suspenseful."
"Its a good read; it pulls you in, never boring. Hawkins' use of multiple narrators helps the story flow well.  It is a dark story. The characters are each unlikable, some less than others, like Rachel, the main character. She is the only one in the book I could feel for.  I can't quite understand why some characters were the way the were, like Detective Riley. I guess my imagination will fill in the gaps there. There is a turning point in which the book becomes a bit predictable, but I can't say when as not to give away any spoilers."
"I was hopeful with this book but truthfully was not very impressed.  While it had alternating persons telling the story, it jumped around too much at first in my honest opinion.  I knew it would ultimately come together at the end, but I found myself questioning whether the author was trying to be ""sophisticated"" and it was a little unnecessary, because not only did they describe a certain date but also whether it was the morning or evening.  That could've easily been determined if it wasn't broken up into sub-categories but just mentioned in the writing.  I also didn't find too much depth in the characters.  It was clear one of the handful of characters was the guilty party and it wasn't difficult to figure out by process of elimination.  It was a little disappointing. Just my 2c."
"This book takes hold of you from the very first page and never lets go.  You get involved with the characters,  the plot, and all the twists and turns.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Hope Hollywood does it good."
"I like that the killer is totally someone different than you'd expect and that it is written from three perspectives. Would definitely recommend hardcover or paperback rather than kindle as the dates bounce around. It was a little hard to read about the constant drunkenness and alcoholism, and this made it a little frustrating in the first half from Rachel's perspective, because all I could think was get it together! But as someone who is trying to understand the disease of alcoholism and addiction for a family member in my own life it was helpful to sort of see their struggles, self-loathing, and first hand disease. It sets the book up brilliantly as to how/why the killer did what he did. Excited to discuss at book club."
"It took awhile for me to understand the narration.  Just who was this Megan person anyway?? It was trying to read about an alcoholic who would voice the right things to do yet she would always do that which would damage her.  She really had no life of her own and lived in the past, bothering her ex husband and his wife, acting as if she were commuting work daily to avoid criticism from her landlord/roommate, dreaming about those people she saw in her old neighborhood as she rode the train.It seems the rambling thoughts and actions would go on forever and without purpose.  Finally the fragmented thoughts and storyline started coming together and suspense began to build.  The last half was a good story but I did question myself for many pages as to why I was still reading this book."
"Great read for my cross country flight, it's a page turner or Kindle tapper to be more accurate. I doubt much of the story or characters will stay with me for long except for the alcoholic Rachel. As with any mystery if you figure it out too early on the rest becomes tedious. For me that was the case with this book and then suspense turned into impatience. But on the other hand if I hadn't been able to somewhat figure it out on my own I would have felt it was an ""unfair"" mystery so all good in the end!"
"This book is a very good read.  I have been at the book store and near the shelves that house this book and heard a person giving their opinion of the book to others and they could not have been more wrong. Then turning to me and saying ""Don't waste your time it is not a good book.""  Not to give any spoilers but what they were commenting about was the writing and how it was a little ""All over"".  It is supposed to be written like that, from the point view of the main character who has some issues and needs to figure out what is real or not.  I really enjoyed this book and know several others who have too."
"I was spellbound, could not wait to get to this book every day, but my balloon of excitement and admiration burst with the ending. It was as if the author could not think of a good ending, so decided:""Let me get this over with, I will just write anything to end this mystery"", and here we were stranded with a no good solution that did not hold water after all the excitement that we had built up.Inger Ross-Kristensen"
So many twists and turns.  So many screwed up personalities. I felt it was depressing from the get go.  The more I read the more the personalities become more screwy.  Not a feel good read.  More like pathetic lives getting more pathetic.
"Confusing ... took me 3 times to get through the beginning because of the way the author makes the name of each chapter a character's name and goes back and forth in time.  For this reason, I had to keep putting it down.  Then time lapsed and I had to start over.  Finally put it down again for a long time and decided just finish it already which I did quickly.  Picked up the last 40 pages so only an OK."
"Good opening, entices the reader into the story.  The three person narratives at times became confusing, especially if the reader put down the book and did not read it straight through, since there certain similarities in the character's traits. The author made good use of an ordinary circumstance of daily train riding to bring home a lot of good points.  The train is a metaphor for the lives of the three women in varying stages of decision making; Rachel caught in between life and destruction, Anna craving to move and Meghan who actually does make a move. I found their stories so intertwined for a while I thought they might be one woman with three personalities. I found the ending justified and was glad the author indicated the forward movement of the remaining characters. A good, light summer read."
"After all the hype, I was expecting more mystery and drama........sort of a nail-biter. But it's not that kind of book. It's more about what goes on in several character's heads, especially the main woman. It was just okay."
"This is a page turner. I was completely engaged in the story and always in suspense. I loved how the writing alternated between characters and how you really get in their head and yet see what they think of the others! The alcoholism was accurately portrayed. So glad I did not watch the movie first as I wanted to create my own visuals and see if the director was able to bring it. Good movie but disappointing in regard to being true to the story and bringing the suspense. For one the setting takes place in the USA in the movie. Wtf? I wanted it to be in England! Too many things missing from the movie as well, but thats the way it is. Books are ALWAYS better! Great read. I recommended it to my friends and they were NOT disappointed!"
"The book was well written: there weren't many cliche' bits and there wasnt too corny an ending.  It kept me up thinking and wanting to continue to read on, even as my eyes were shutting. Interesting twists and turns to keep us off guessing how things would work up to the end.  Definitely a youth or young adult read."
"I am in the minority that didn't love this book.  It was slow in places and the final twist fell flat for me.  I guessed the person about half way through and was disappointed to find out that I was right.  I did like the feeling of being the person on the train who is playing Nancy Drew to help solve the mystery, however the drunken blackouts became predictable and made me skim the pages a bit.  I enjoyed the writing, however I would not call this the next Gone Girl.  I do not think the writing quality or story telling is anywhere near that of Gillian Flynn.  I think if you are looking for a Flynn style psychological thriller, you should pick up Mud Vein or Marrow by Tarryn Fisher.  The Girl On The Train is not as dark and twisted as I was hoping it to be."
"I bought this book mainly because it had been #1 NYTimes best-seller.  Big mistake.  I regret the time I wasted reading it.The vast majority of the plot energy centers around the female protagonists triumphantly discovering, verifying, agonizing over, and obsessing over the infidelity of their husbands. There is not one word about any attempts to solve problems or make a better marriage. There is not one word about the good side of any marriage.. On the contrary,If this bleep is to be believed, the only propose of marriage is lose-lose to give e the wife cause to feel bigtime aggrieved.  If that were the case, women's best course would always be to avoid marriage altogetherThat said, Hawkins weaves  in a powerful and non-preachy.anti-alcohol subtext.  If this book saves one young woman from life-destroying ravages of drink, that would be terrific.  But a good read it is not."
"Mixed emotions here.  I was really looking forward to this book, based on the reviews, liking this type of book, having lived in London, and rode the train numerous times.  Maybe my expectations were, therefore, too high.  I found it hard to ""root for"" anyone; even the main character was hard to feel for, as her difficulties were for the most part self inflicted.  You have to pay attention reading this book.  The chapters switch among the three main characters, which was easy enough to follow.  But what I missed at first is that they are not necessarily in chronological order.  So when I got to a new chapter and saw which character's perspective was being told, I had to read the date and then go back to the previous chapter and compare dates to see if I was going backwards in time.  Easy enough to figure out, but just something to keep track of.  I never got to the point of ""can't wait to pick it up and read some more"", although I was interested enough to finish it just to see what happened.  I thought the writing was well done.  Good book, not great."
"After first hearing Paula Hawkins on NPR last year, I knew I had to read this book myself.  The problem was that it was too far down on my TBR pile for me to get to it anytime in the near future.Last night, however, I finished it.  I couldn't stop with ten pages left! I had to know!  I wasn't suspect of the killer the whole length of the book, so kudos.  Thank you for writing a page turner. For me, it was never dull at all. I will just have an extra shot of espresso in my coffee now that I stayed up too late finishing this one.Highly recommended!"
"A good read.  I like books instead of movies, so this was one that I might've gone to ""see"" in the theatre...  (I know there's a movie now and am considering it.)  Loved the twists and turns and the ending."
very nice book with a well written easy to read. a surprising events and you will not understand until you finish the book. every single corner of this novel contain a story. waiting to see the movie.
I was disappointed given the large number of stars many readers gave this book. I think 3 neurotic characters is way too much for a story - I felt like I was bouncing back and forth among the storied women and none of them evolved into a substantive character.
"I found this book very difficult to get into at the start. I had to go back to the previous chapter to check dates, but once I realized what the author was doing, the story became more suspenseful. It starts with Rachel, a train commuter, imagining the life stories of the people she sees out the window of the train everyday as she passes. She is especially concerned with a couple that lives in a house in her old neighborhood. She believes their life to be perfect. But all that changes as the woman turns out to be missing and the story turns to reality. Now the author moves the story along as told by the three main characters viewing the same events from each characters point of view. It was very interesting and difficult to decide who had the correct view as each had their own previous experiences that colors their outlook and Rachel has a drinking problem with blackouts. Rachel complicates matters becoming involved in the reality mixing it with what she had imagined.Even though I had trouble getting started, I kept reading because of all the previous great reviews and was rewarded with a great and differently told mystery story."
"Let's get something straight, I finished this book in less than 24 hours. Couldn't put it down but mostly because I wanted to see if I was right...and I was. Writing-good, characters-good, storyline-good. But if you're a regular reader of thrillers then it's not difficult to figure out. All that being said, I'm glad I read it and I look forward to the movie in October."
"This book is often compared to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which was a much better book IMO. As I read this book I was often able to predict what would happen next, and the author's attempts to create suspense<U+200B> sometimes fell flat."
"I was surprised to see so many five star reviews for this book. About the only part I could agree with was that Rachel's character was indeed bleak. The plot was limited as a soap opera, and I felt there had to be more to Rachel as a human being than this sniveling, self-absorbed wimp completely dependent on others. All three women base their happiness on whether or not they are desired by men. Scenes of confrontation that could be have been filled with dramatic tension, such as the ending scenes with Rachel and Anna, or Rachel and Tom, ended up contrived and ho-hum. I wanted Rachel to discover something about herself or reach deep within for inner strength she didn't know she had. I like to be left with thought-provoking ideas at the end of a book. I didn't feel anything with Girl on the Train."
"Though the book, like a train, took a bit to get up to speed, I really liked where Paula went with this.  I found myself becoming attached to the 3 main characters and loved how their stories unfolded. The read is pretty simple, yet very enjoyable."
"I absolutely loved this book. I have heard it being compared to Gillian Flynn's works, and I guess I see a slight similarity, but Hawkins did a great job of setting her own tone & pace. It's painful reading from the main character's perspective sometimes because she is just so screwed up, but the book itself was a great read. Enough twists and turns to keep me on my toes, and only a tiny bit predictable on occasion.I have said this to everyone I've recommended it to: The main character's room mate is the unsung hero of the book. What she deals with... pffft. I don't think I know anyone who would tolerate their room mate to act the way the main character does."
"A very dark and depressing book. I only finished reading it because I wanted to find out who the murderer was. I didn't care for the chapters toggling between dates in time and characters. The three main female characters were hard to differentiate in personality as were the two male characters. Lastly, the book would have been much more enjoyable if a British vernacular was used. Were it not for the names of the towns and a few other words or phrases, one would think the setting was in Canada or the US."
"This novel is written exactly as a movie, particularly the doble ending, so you're actually reading a thriller you might as well watch in a theater.  The writing is compelling and keeps you reading until you realize this is just another story written by the numbers with a very predictable ending.  Female characters are minimally interesting and the men don't come through as real and the action and red herrings are very transparent. If you are a regular reader of thriller and mysteries, you'll guess this one before you're half way through.  I suggest wait for the film that is already made or buy a cheap used softcover."
"I read this for my book club; otherwise I don't think I would have read this on my own. The book was too much of a downer for me. All the women's stories are pathetic and tawdry, and they seem clueless about how to improve their circumstances. I don't like reading woman as victim stories, and this one is no exception, even when two of them get past the hatred for each other and team up to expose a killer. The book is well written and the plot is suspenseful, but the ending is rather predictable. I didn't understand what all the hype was about and sorry to say, I still don't."
"I really enjoyed this novel.  There's already tons of in-depth reviews, so I'm not going to do that.  I will say that at the beginning I was saying to myself, well this is just odd.  But soon I was completely involved and didn't want to put it down.  After I finished, I needed to talk about it, it really stuck with me.  So I googled the title and found a fantastic spoiler discussion and that was a great debrief for me.  It was really great to see what everyone thought of different things.  Specifically, I was shocked when I read that some people knew whodunnit before half way.  I certainly did not identify the person, and only had a pretty good guess before the denouement.  I may read it again.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
"Good story, though a bit dark.  I actually detest books and movies that are too dark, but this one had a small element of perseverance that helped me swallow some of the dark parts.  All in all it was still very entertaining.  I had trouble putting it down, but some of the ""twists"" were fairly predictable.  I was so engrossed by the main character that I had to catch myself from thinking I had some of her same issues!  Some of the suspense was created by some slightly frustrating means (continually forgetting certain details, not realizing certain things about her past), but still made for a great book.  Not on my top 20 list, but I would still recommend it.  Plus, it's a fast read, so why not?"
"I wanted to love this book. Unfortunately I guessed who the murderer was when the character was introduced by Meagan. Am I a super sleuth or even a third tier Nancy Drew, nope it's that obvious. I think for me the rush of recovered memories at the end was disingenuous. Also the loving odes to Rachel's various alcoholic drinks were beyond tedious. I don't know if it was intended by the author and I am displaying my ignorance of a literary device but the drinks were a well established character. There were parts that were smart and I would become engaged, but then we were back on train sipping a G&T."
"This was for book club and we were all in agreement - utterly forgettable beach read. As this book was compared to Gone Girl and Rear Window we went in with high hopes. Unfortunately, you have three unsympathetic, unlikeable women who are unreliable narrators with similar voices, and the two-dimensional dysfunctional men in their lives. I figured out the murderer about two-thirds of the way into the book. The ending is nothing short of unbelievable. The one thing the author does get right is that alcohol-driven black outs are not caused by the failure to remember, but the brain’s failure to transfer events from short term to long term memory. She then discards this fact when her plot’s stuck and she needs Rachel to remember something in order to end the story. A very disappointing read."
"What a miserable waste of time and money! There is virtually no story line--just the rambling, disconnected thoughts of some miserable soul. I quit reading a quarter of the way through--utterly boring. (And as an English major, I will read most anything, including the back of cereal boxes, most of which are more entertaining than The Girl on the Train."
"Up until the last 20 - 30 pages, I was all set to give this book 3 stars.  I thought it was well-written and kept my attention, however, I had a very difficult time with Rachel.  I don't have to like characters in a book, but I like to understand why they do the things they do ... so that I can at least have empathy for them if not sympathy.  But, in the end, I not only felt empathy for Rachel ... but sympathy as well ... and found myself really rooting for her.  I figure that's a pretty good book that can change my feelings about a main character so drastically."
"I was excited to read this book because Amazon suggested it was similar to Gone Girl. However except for the multiple point of view format, the book is not great.I had to force myself to continue reading through the poor writing. I believe a good author would use descriptive words, not generalization of moods and character based on brands.( there was a lot of name dropping, was the author beings sponsored by these companies?)The book was shallow, the characters were shallow and I felt uncomfortable with the way women were depicted as weak victims and men as testosterone driven neanderthals.I loved the premise of the book, which is the only thing that kept me reading through the events and characters that were not clever or interesting."
"I read ""The Girl on the Train"" entirely on the train--actually the subway--and it's a great, light read for my commute (unlike Rachel, I don't drink on the train, but I do love to read to pass the time!). It was a compelling premise--woman thinks she might have been witness to a crime, but doesn't remember due to alcoholic blackouts--and definitely passed the time entertainingly, although it did get a little repetitious in the last third of the story. The use of shifting narrators was clever, but not quite clever enough to stop me from figuring out the true killer ages before the denouement!"
"If you're looking for an easy, enjoyable read without too much depth, this book is for you.A decent novel by anyone's standards. Well written with the right amount of humor and wit. (British humor and language is always something I enjoy -- a break from the norm.)However, I don't see what all the rave is about. It's another Gone Girl in style and plot. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely a page turner and I often found myself wanting to get back to reading as soon as possible. But, in the end, I just did not love this book.I guess with all the hype about how great of a novel this was, I got my hopes up. High expectations and average quality make for a semi-letdown reader."
"This is not my usual genre, but I am so glad I read it. Ms. Hawkins, you are phenomenal,####spoiler alert###I was so confused, I actually thought Rachel did it. I was like damn she was so angry about about Meg cheating on Scott she killed the B, and what the hell did Meg sleep with the psychiatrist??? And Anna, so vapid until the end then wham!! She is just as crazy as the rest of them and you realize the only same one is the drunk. The ending is not happy, not really. But its the only realistic way it could have ended."
"This debut novel is told via three first-person narrators, all female, one of whom is the title character.  I found Rachel, the alcoholic title character, sufficiently complex and believable; though her excessive drinking makes her somewhat contemptible, it also makes her human, and I was able to empathize with her.  (Rachel's drinking is a necessary plot element, as it prevents her from remembering critical events.)  What makes this a less impressive novel than ""Gone Girl"" is the novel's narration.  One narrator is somehow able to recount for readers what is happening to her as she dies.  The mystery surrounding her death is, however, suspenseful enough to make the novel an interesting read."
"I knew this story was not going to be pretty; after all, the main character is a pathetic drunk and a compulsive liar.  Every person in this sordid little drama has something to hide, and the book is written in such a way that the hidden parts don't fit together 'til the very end. The rotating viewpoints got to be tedious and confusing, especially since I wasn't able to read many chapters at one sitting. If you read this novel as an e-book, the repeated chapter headings with the same names will make it difficult to keep your place in the story line. I agree with many other reviewers; there was not a single character in this book that had any redeeming qualities. That said, I can't say I hated it; they all got exactly what they deserved from each other, as a bunch of scheming, selfish, violent liars."
"Interesting plot twist though by the time the book got there I had figured it out.  This story starts out very slow, and I nearly stopped reading out of boredom and thought about deleting it.  However, I stuck with it and the last half of the story was much better than the beginning.  I wish the entire novel would have read as well as the last portion.  I wouldn't call this one a ""must read"" but it wasn't a waste of time either.  If you have time to read the entire story in one or two sittings, it's probably worthwhile.  Otherwise, I would pass on this one and look for something that flows better."
"Having truly hated the book ""Gone Girl"", I can't stand the comparisons many make. Yes, they both are dark, twisted mysteries with unlikeable protagonists; but, while I found GG to be predictable and without any redemption, I found ""The Girl on the Train"" to be engrossing and at least somewhat redeemable. I've given it 3-stars only because I found it a bit hard to follow the characters at first and all the time jumps. I wish I had listened to it on audiobook (which I basically never say!) as I hear it was a really astounding book to listen to and more clear with the use of 3 distinct voices."
"Rachel, the girl on the train, has had a rough time of it.  She's definitely not where she thought she would be.  Rachel would ride the train to London every day for work, watching the houses as they passed.  One of the houses that she watched was the one that she use to share with her ex-husband.  Tom now shares that home with his former mistress, now his wife, and his infant daughter.  Four doors down, is a house just like hers use to be.  Rachel watches the couple in that house and creates an imaginary life for them in her mind.  She imagines their names, their love for each other, their life together.  Things are not as she imagines and as her drinking gets more and more out of hand, her bad decisions lead her down a dangerous path."
"I am always drawn to stories told in first person and this book is a great one.  The story as it unfolds, is told by the three women in it.  These are real women---flawed but so human.  One has a problem with alcohol, one a problem with restlessness and fidelity and one has compromised for security and a ""dream"" life.  You will find yourself annoyed with them at times and at other times cheering for their small victories.  The story involves a disappearance of one of the women and how the other women and the men in their lives are all drawn into the mystery.  The plot is intriguing and clever the way it unfolds.  It builds to a great ending that ties everything and everyone together.  All questions come together and are answered.  I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened!"
"I am reviewing this book in my husband's account as we share it and I am the one that purchased this book. I enjoyed the book overall and found it a quick and easy read. There were not many characters to follow which kept the ""mental effort"" a bit low at times and I found myself wishing the plot could have moved a bit more quickly. That's being said, I did enjoy the character development and final twist. I have loaned the book to several friends and everyone has enjoyed the read. I have read better books but many that are much worse!"
"I really enjoyed reading this book.  It kept my interest and I found myself looking for time to ""squeeze in"" a few more pages.  I actually finished itby reading late into the night under a ""sheet tent"" in bed so as not to wake my husband with the light from my Kindle. I did predict the ""bad guy"" early on, but I tend to do this with maddening accuracy on movies, books, or stories my friends relate to me.  The Girl On The Train did movingly portray the costly nature of alcoholism realistically from the alcoholic's viewpoint and her understanding of the frustration felt  by family, friends, and life bystanders.  All in all, an entertaining, easy read."
"This was a pretty good book. It moved a little slowly at first, then picked up and had a slightly unpredictable twist. I say that because it was sort of expected but you were not so sure until your suspicions were confirmed. It was a good, relatively easy read and I would recommend it. It does provide an insight to the sort of darkness that envelops you when a vice takes you over. That aspect was the most interesting; being brought into the fictional world of an alcoholic and sufferer of depression was fascinating."
"I absolutely adored this book. I will not going into detail as to what happens, because I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but this book will keep you on your toes. You almost feel creeped out at times by the rising in tension and switching points of views. It was a wonderful experience reading this book. I didn't expect the ending at all, which doesn't happen often! It's a book that gives you relief and sadness when it's over. I would (and have) definitely recommend to a friend, or anyone who likes psychological thrillers. 10/10."
"I read this book with high hopes as Gone Girl was really enjoyable. If you haven't read Gone Girl, this book would be a good read but I feel they had too many similarities. It was also a little slow and the female characters all seemed very weak and poorly developed. It does quite a bit of jumping from future to past which might make it hard to follow if you don't pay attention to the dates that the chapter has at each beginning.Overall not a terrible book, but like I said it seemed to similar to Gone Girl and the characters seemed a little flat for me with no real hook to keep my attention."
"The narrative style that alternates between three of the main characters is a clever and fascinating way to tell a story about love and marriage. The entire novel is an interesting commentary on the role played by memory, perception and observation and how little of it can be trusted.This is not a story for those seeking flawless heroines and heroic men. All of the characters are deeply flawed. The three main women - Rachel, Megan, Anna are compelling nonetheless. They make terrible mistakes and use incredibly poor judgement. Alcoholism, lying and cheating are not held up as excuses for their destructive behavior. Above all, they are human. The author brought all of these characters together in a skillful, although not totally unexpected way.Four stars because the end was a little too neat."
"Although I have not read ""Gone Girl,"" the story contained within ""The Girl on the Train"" is very reminiscent of that story--thrilling, gripping, mysterious, unsettling. As soon as you wrap your mind around the world the author has developed, you will be hooked. As the characters begin to interact, the plot twists and turns in unexpected ways that will more than likely leave you reading this book within a minimum of 24 hours. I literally purchases this book last night before falling asleep, read it for 4 hours, woke up, read it for another 4 hours, and was blown away by its resolution. A must read for anyone who loves a story with a good twist."
"This one kept me turning the pages.  It presents you with a cast of characters who's lives have touched.  They are all woven together by the relentless imagination of one alcoholic and tragically lonely women, Rachel.  While you know that she has an active imagination you go right along with her as she attempts to make sense out of her rudderless life.  She manages to drag her ex-husband and his family into her drama and a couple that lives a few doors down as well.  Every day brings just a little more information to the light.  But what is true and what has her mind made up?  It is a page turner and when one of the characters goes missing it keeps you up at night trying to reach the conclusion.  A good one.  Well worth it."
"I bought this book just because it was on the best seller list without looking what it was about. I really like the premise about an alcoholic girl who witnessed things important to a murder investigation that no one believes. The book is told from three different women's point of view. The main thing I disliked about the book was the changing of perspectives that I felt weren't transitioned particularly well to form a seamless story early. Later on they started making a lot more sense, and were a lot smoother. All together it was a decent but slightly depressing with very few if any characters that are likable."
"The Girl On The Train was a really great story!  The author has a way of making you relate to very unlikable and undesirable people.  It was suspenseful, the writing was good and I didn't find a lot of typos or issues while reading this book.  I saw other reviewers that were very negative and claimed that ""the author with-held important information and tricks you...""  And to that I say ""So when reading every book ever, you go in with full knowledge of everything that is happening to all of the characters automatically - Or do you read and learn more information as you go???""  This book was no different than any other suspenseful, mysterious, fictional book I've read.  It was Thoroughly enjoyable --- READ IT!!  You won't regret it!  ~Niki Noel"
"I very much enjoyed this book...I was easily caught up in the downward spiral of the main character and found her both appealing and repulsive.  Some of her actions seemed uncharacteristic, but since I am not an alcoholic, I may not be the proper judge.  The writing is very good and the character development, though a little spotty for the ancillary characters, was pretty intense for the main character.  I subsequently saw the film and enjoyed it just as much.  It definitely was a benefit to have read the book."
"Every once in a while I read a contemporary book and wonder how in the world it made it to the best seller list.  This book is an example.  While the mystery itself is interesting, I have read many that are far, far better.  The chief problem is that all three of the female characters are similar, and the two male characters are nearly identical .  Furthermore, each character began to sound like the other.  It is the responsibility of the writer to have each of the characters speak differently--different rhythms, different word choices--all this helps the reader to differentiate who is who.  Now it is perhaps just possible that the author's intention was to say we are all alike, but I don't think the novel is that sophisticated. If you want a good train mystery, may I suggest Agatha Christie."
"What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren’t entirely reliable or likeable. One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel, who is battling alcoholism. She says, “How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all these electronics and traces it leaves.”The first person narrators don’t have distinctive voices, so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter, it will take you a second to figure out who is talking (you can figure out if it’s Rachel if she’s talking about how much she wants a drink, for example.) All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn’t wait to come back to it to find out what happened, and I wasn’t disappointed."
"It is popular and I was curious. It is interesting as a tour de force in the psychological genre, but I found it diffuse and a bit tedious. I never felt that I cared about any of the characters in the story. The journey I was being led on thus never really captured my imagination. To me, that is a significant failure in plot and character development. Perhaps, it is just not my type."
"Wow! This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down and wanted to read it any chance I could. It was suspenseful! The main character, Rachel witnesses a couple outside their home every day from a stop on a train and becomes a bit obsessed with their lives. She names them and imagines what they are like. She envies them since her own marriage failed. The funny thing is, her exhusband remarried and lives right near this couple.  But then the lady she often sees, Megan, goes missing! It's a mystery and an obsession for Rachel. She gets to be a part of their lives through lies and her obsessive snooping. She is an unreliable narrator since she also has a bit of a problem with getting flat-out blackout no memory drunk. Such a treat to read. You will be bummed out once you finish it : ("
"When I first perused this book I was not impressed. But then last Wednesday came along and I had spent days preparing for a medical test and after that was done all I wanted was to get lost in a great book. Luckily I picked up The Girl on the Train again and was off and Running. A day later, I was done and completely satisfied with the talents of the author and wished I could hop into another one by her. Sadly, I have not found one yet. If you love to get lost in a powerful story with very well drawn characters and a stunningly artful plot with suspects galore except for the surprise ending, then be my guest. Buy your ticket today for a wonderful ride on the train of Hawkins Imagination and you too will take a trip via her talents which you will be grateful for."
"I found the story extremely boring. I quite before getting one third into the story as it seemed to just go on and on and on, and on, and I kept asking myself what is the point?  Finally, I realized I don't even care what the point is anymore. With nothing happening, I simply quit reading it.  The great reviews I don't get at all."
"From all that I'd heard and read about this book, it still wasn't quite what I expected. It moved slowly in the beginning and was kind of confusing. There were times when I went back and reread to keep the characters straight. It did pick up the pace in the middle and raced to the end, sort of like a train. I thought the characters could be developed more. You only know them superficially. When I finished the book, I still wanted to know more about them and their motives. Still it was a pretty good read and I was sort of surprised at the end."
"I would have given this 5 stars if it had been written in 3rd person and past tense.  There are 3 narrators and they all sound alike.  There is no difference in their thought patterns or modes of speech.  I think that writing in the 3rd person would have helped the author to make these characters ' voices more distinct.  As for writing in present tense, that's one of my pet peeves and probably won't bother anyone else.The plot, pacing and atmosphere are truly excellent.  I was kept guessing right up till the end, and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  I look forward to Paula Hawkins' next book with great anticipation!"
"This was definitely the best book I have read in a very long time!  From the very beginning, I was captivated by the characters and the suspense.  Paula Hawkins does a wonderful job of developing fascinating characters, and the plot is absolutely amazing, creative and suspenseful.  I had no idea ""who did it"" until very close to the end.  The writing is excellent, and I do hope she will continue to write books, and I will certainly follow her.  I read this book in only a couple days, because I simply could not put it down.  I could've read it even faster if I didn't have a few other things to do from time to time (like cook, clean, etc.)  I'm definitely looking forward to this author's next book."
"I really liked this book. I was skeptical that I would like it as much as I did, given how some reviewers compared it to Gone Girl, which I hated. There were some slow spots, and the main character's drunkenness got a bit tedious at times. However, the author did a great job building suspense. I was sure I knew the identity of the killer early on, but the twists and turns in the story made me realize my initial assumption was incorrect. Kudos for tricking me, even though I did figure it out before any of the characters <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>"
"I first read a small snippet of what this book was about from a magazine and it sounded so good,I couldn't wait to read it.I was a fan on Gone Girl and this definitely read similar to that I'd say. It was unexpected that so much of the story is inside the character's heads and really not much dialogue or your typical mystery/suspense book. It was a fast read that kept me interested, but once I figured out the ""twist"" I thought the ending fell a little flat for me. I was expecting/hoping for something more. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities and overall I felt like it was a lesson in ""the grass isn't always greener.."" type of thing. I read this book while on vacation and it was perfect for that."
"I haven't finished it yet but am 3/4 through.  Really like it... I listen to it in my car when driving.  Sometimes when I arrive at my destination, I sit in the car to listen more because I don't want to stop 'reading' it.  I thought it was a comedy and it is not...it is a murder mystery but a good book all the same.  Not real fond of the F word and some content was uncomfortable for me personally so that is why the 3 not because of the author but the content of infidelity, mental illness, alcoholism, etc."
"I was personally recommended this book by a coworker and man am I glad that she recommended it! It is an amazing tale told from three different women's points of view. Rachel-a battered, alcoholic who was left by her husband for another takes the train everyday and imagines made up lives of people who live on the stops of the train. Megan-who suffers from guilt, anxiety and loss who tries to mask her pain in things she shouldn't. And Anna-a wife and mother who is trying to deal with her husband's ex all the while trying to be the perfect mother and beautiful wife. Their stories intertwine and lead up to a Saturday night when a great mystery happens. Filled with suspense, mystery, death and what real life throws at us ""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent novel!!!"
"This book was a bit too unbelievable even for fiction. It follows the lives of three women and their love intrests who all live on the same block and get to know each other through very contried circumstances. The characters were somewhat compelling but not very likeable.  I certainly wouldn't want to befriend any of the three main characters Rachael, Megan, or Anna. I found I could not identify or sympathize too much with any of them. The author switches between characters telling the storyline bouncing from each point of view.  The male counterparts were not nice guys. I found myself asking why I was reading a book about people I didn't like who did horrible things to each other and so many people involved in the plots. Just happy I don't live on that block."
"Over 5000 reviews so not much more to add here... But....Did I enjoy this book?  Yes.Is it a page turner?  Yes.Did I want to read this book when I wasn't?  Yes.  So got through it in a day and a half.  Nice way to spend a rainy weekend...Was it worth the Kindle price?  ($9.17 US) Yes.Did I learn something form this book? No.  With some books you walk away knowing that you have learned something about life or some aspect of life and in some ways, have grown from the experience.  But to be fair, while I did enjoy this book immensely, I am not a wiser/better person for it.SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTOk, if Megan never told anyone but her therapist about Libby (and he's not allowed to say) and Mac is dead, how did the media find out?"
"I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did.  I'm a stickler for well drawn out characters, authentic dialogue and believable plots.  When I started this book it hooked me right from the get-go, which I love, and had me counting the hours until I could sit down and read some more.  I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Not a terribly involved and twisted plot line, but I love the unreliable narrator aspect of it, and this author clearly knows how to use that and make it work."
"I love mystery novels.  Twisted, simple or predictable, they appeal to my glass is half empty dark side.  But I also love depth in characters, which appeals to the psychologist in me.  The story is clever and twisted.  The idea of time and perspective as essential parts of the story is a good one.  Without the depth of character, the interruptions make the story seem somewhat more convoluted than clever and the characters more caricatures than complex.  An excellent first beginning with hopefully greater character development without the flighty time transitions to distract from the great use of language."
Hated it. I couldn't read more than a few chapters. Boring
This one is not real deep and leaves me feeling a bit sorry for so many pathetic yet relatable characters.  We've all met each of these personalities at some point. The multiple narrators format kept me reading and somewhat entertained waiting for the final twist. Good book to read on a plane or...a train.
"i honestly don't get all the hoo-ha regarding this book...in fact, i found it so boring that i quit 2/3's in... i did skip to the end to see who ""done it"", but i had no empathy whatsoever for the protagonist, who is an unrepentant alcoholic and liar who makes life miserable for her long-suffering roommate as well as herself..don't bother with this book, there are so many better written ones with more interesting storylines and female protagonists.. such as the latest by karin slaughter..."
"While the writing style of going back and forth between characters - perhaps emulating the back and forth motions of the protagonist on the train, the writing itself felt redundant rather than allowing the story to progress. The ""who done it"" aspect of the story is well told and there is intrigue, but I question how this book rose to become a best seller."
Interesting at first.  Became a bit tedious and unrealistic as it progressed.  Really-an ex wife walks off with your baby and no one calls the police and they continue to allow her to the house?  It just because. So implausible that it lost its entertainment value.  I also wasn't expecting it to be go dark and depressing.
"The book is well written and edited. No complaints there. But for the most part, it's painfully boring.  The entire story could be told in fifty pages, but the author takes three hundred before making it interesting.The main character is another issue. Pathetic and uninteresting. A loser from beginning to almost end. I would not recommend this book."
Was I the only person who thought this book was terrible? Aside from being completely implausible (but not ridiculous enough to be entertaining or diabolical enough to be disturbing) the protagonist was annoying. I hate to describe a character so teenager like but there really isn't much of a redemption in her character or a better way to say it. She's self aware enough and self loathing enough that I couldn't relate or empathize. I struggled to finish this book.
Very slow read.Too much repetition. Disappointed
I don't think this book is worth all the hype.  Actually really a ridiculous story and rather NOT believable characters.  Disappointing read.  Was  what we read for a Book Club discussion and we were all disappointed.
"I've read other excellent reviewers who found the changes in POV and changes in time confusing, but for me they worked quite well.  In fact, the story and the suspense wouldn't have worked without these jumps and I very much liked trying to figure out who thought what when.  All 3 female characters (the 3 POVs) have their perspectives, their differences, and their psychological limitations, so being inside each separately adds to the plots tension.  It's hard to believe that this is a first novel by Paula Hawkins and I look forward to her next.  The Girl on the Train is a fast read and I recommend it highly."
I saw this novel on the best seller list so I decided to read it. I cannot really judge it accurately because it is not my type of novel. The first few chapters were complex and slow but I stayed with it. As the pieces came together the story held my interest. The fact that I finished this book speaks for itself.  It is possible I should have given it four but for me it was not a rapid page turner.
"I didn't like the ""first person"" writing style. I thought the book was overrated, and I couldn't wait until I finished it. I feel that it has a decent storyline, but it just didn't hold my interest."
